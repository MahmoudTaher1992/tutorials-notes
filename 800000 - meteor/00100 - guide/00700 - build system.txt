Build system
    > it is a command line tool
    > use it by typing meteor
    > compiles, runs, deploys, and publishes all of your Meteor apps and packages

    > Reloads app on file change
        > after you start building the app using meteor build command, it will automatically rebuild and restart the app on file change

    > Compiles files with build plugins
        > the main function of the build tool is to run the build plugins
        > build plugins define the app build process
        
        > the configuration of the build process is done through
            > adding/removing packages
            > adding/removing files in special directories

        > controlling which files to build
            > by default it is controlled by
                > your application file structure
                > default file load order rules

            > you can override the behavior by adding .meteorignore file
        
        > Combines and minifies code 
            > important feature of meteor build
            > it automatically concatenates your application asset files
            > in production it minifies the code
            > you can add comments and spaces as you like
            > you can split the files as you like

        > Development vs. production
            > in development, the main goal is fast rebuilds
                > use `meteor run`
            > in production, the main goal is small downloads and fast startup
                > to debug minified version locally, use `meteor --production`

        > Javascript transpilation
            > javascript is continuously evolving, but browsers are slow to adopt new features
            > a transpilers are used to convert new javascript code to old javascript code compatible with browsers
            > meteor use that as well

            > examples
                > ES2015+
                    > ecmascript package
                    > adds support for many ES2015 features

                > Babel
                    > configurable transpiler
                    > let's you use the latest javascript features
                    > will be used by meteor to transpile your code

                > CoffeeScript
                    > coffeescript package
                    > transpile coffeescript to javascript

                > Typescript
                    > typescript package
                    > transpile Typescript to javascript
