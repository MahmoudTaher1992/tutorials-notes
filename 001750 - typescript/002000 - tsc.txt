tsc
    > A compiler is a program that compiles (transforms) one code to another
    > The output of your typescript/javascript will be running on web browsers or node
    > Web Browsers/node 
        > can not understand typescript
        > they only understand javascript
        > some one should do the transpilation
            > tsc can do it
            > also babel can do it
    > babel vs tsc
        > tsc checks on the types before transpilation
        > babel doesn't
        > If you are going to go with babel, then you should let tsc do the type checking
            > you can configure tsc to do type checking only --no-emit
        > You can configure both so that they target specific environments
            > specific Web Browsers
            > specific node
