LLMs
    > stands for Large Language Models
    > definition
        > LLMs are AI programs that recognize and generate text 
        > They are trained on massive datasets
        > built on transformer models, a type of neural network
            > use neural networks, specifically transformer models, to learn context and relationships within language
            > Transformer models use self-attention to understand the nuances of language
        > built on machine learning and use deep learning models to identify patterns and make distinctions without human intervention
    > How They Learn
        > LLMs use deep learning to understand relationships between words and sentences
        > They are then fine-tuned for specific tasks
    > uses
        > Generative AI
        > code generation
        > chatbots
        > language translation
        > summarization

    > limitations
        > Reliability depends on training data, which can be biased
        > Can "hallucinate
        > security breaches
        > Risk of exposing confidential data
    > Building LLMs
        > need access to large datasets and infrastructure
