AI agents
    > a software program that can interact with its environment, collect data, and use the data to perform self-determined tasks
    > you can build your own AI agent
    
    > benefits
        > Increased Efficiency
        > Improved Accuracy
        > Enhanced Customer Experience
        > Reduced Costs
        > Scalability

    > AI agent components
        > Architecture
            > The foundation on which the agent operates
            > components
                > physical structure
                > software program
                > combination of both

        > Agent function
            > Describes how data is translated into actions

        > Agent Program
            > The actual implementation of the agent function

    > How it works
