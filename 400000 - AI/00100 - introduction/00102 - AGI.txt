AGI
    > stands for Artificial General Intelligence
    > AGI aims to create software with intelligence comparable to humans, capable of self-teaching.
    > AGI should handle tasks it wasn't specifically trained for
        > current AI which operates within predefined parameters
    > Capabilities
        > self-understanding
        > ability to learn new skills
        > self-control

    > it is still a theoretical concept and research goal
        > tech used in AGI 
            > Deep Learning
            > Generative AI
            > NLP
            > Computer Vision
            > Robotics
