    > Prompt Engineering
        > The process of guiding AI to produce desired outputs, by crafting effective inputs.
        > requires detailed instructions
        > Involves choosing optimal formats, phrases, words, and symbols
        > Prompt engineers use creativity plus trial and error to get the most accurate results

    > Prompt
        > Natural language text that requests AI to perform a specific task
        > prompts guides the AI to generate desired outputs
        > uses LLMs to generate text
        > Because LLMs are open ended, prompts are necessary to guide the AI
        > Generative AI requires context and detailed information to produce accurate and relevant responses
