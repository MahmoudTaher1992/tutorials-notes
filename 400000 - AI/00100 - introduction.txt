introduction
    > What is an AI engineer?
        > Role
            > Software engineer specializing in developing, deploying, and maintaining AI systems.
        > Goal
            > Bridge the gap between AI research and real-world applications.
        > Responsibilities
            > Developing, training, and evaluating AI models.
            > Building scalable AI infrastructure (data pipelines, cloud systems).
            > Deploying AI models (model serving, API development).
            > Monitoring and maintaining AI systems.
            > Collaborating with data scientists, software engineers, and product managers.

    > AI impact on product development
        > enhances the process of product development by
            > automating repetitive tasks
            > More accurate decision-making
            > faster time-to-market
            > reducing costs
            
    > AGI
        > stands for Artificial General Intelligence
        > AGI aims to create software with intelligence comparable to humans, capable of self-teaching.
        > AGI should handle tasks it wasn't specifically trained for
            > current AI which operates within predefined parameters
        > Capabilities
            > self-understanding
            > ability to learn new skills
            > self-control

        > it is still a theoretical concept and research goal
            > tech used in AGI 
                > Deep Learning
                > Generative AI
                > NLP
                > Computer Vision
                > Robotics

        > AI vs AGI
            > AI
                > operates within predefined parameters
                > can't handle tasks it wasn't specifically trained for
            > AGI

    > LLMs
        > stands for Large Language Models
        > definition
            > LLMs are AI programs that recognize and generate text 
            > They are trained on massive datasets
            > built on transformer models, a type of neural network
                > use neural networks, specifically transformer models, to learn context and relationships within language
                > Transformer models use self-attention to understand the nuances of language
            > built on machine learning and use deep learning models to identify patterns and make distinctions without human intervention
        > How They Learn
            > LLMs use deep learning to understand relationships between words and sentences
            > They are then fine-tuned for specific tasks
        > uses
            > Generative AI
            > code generation
            > chatbots

        > limitations
            > Reliability depends on training data, which can be biased
            > Can "hallucinate
            > security breaches
            > Risk of exposing confidential data
        > Building LLMs
            > need access to large datasets and infrastructure
