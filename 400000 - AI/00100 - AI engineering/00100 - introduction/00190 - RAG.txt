RAG
    > stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation
    > a technique that enhances LLMs by integrating them with external data sources
        > by combining LLM power with the ability to retrieve information from external sources

    > LLM cons
        > Lack of Specific Information
        > Hallucinations
        > Generic Responses

    > How RAG helps
        > closes the gap between LLMs knowledge and real-world information

    > benefits
        > generating more accurate and contextually relevant responses

    > How RAG works ?
        > Data collection
            > gathers the data needed for the task
        > Data chunking
            > breaking your data down into smaller, more manageable pieces
        > Document embeddings
            > transforms data into embeddings
        > Handling user queries
            > the user query is transformed into an embedding
            > the model retrieves the most relevant documents based on the query embeddings and the document embeddings
        > Generating responses with an LLM
            > the user query and related documents are fed into the LLM

    > Challenges
        > Integrating a retrieval system with an LLM can be difficult
        > efficiency decreases with the size of the external data source and the user's query complexity
