Embeddings
    > embeddings are used to convert complex data into numerical form that models can process more easily
    > in AI, embeddings are a way to represent discrete variables (i.e. words, items, ...) as continuous vectors in a high dimensional space
        > variables
            > discrete variables
                > distinct
                > separate
                > i.e.
                    > words in a vocabulary
                    > product ids
                    > ...
            > continuous vectors
                > continuous values
                > i.e.
                    > temperature
                    > height
                    > ...
        > Vector Representation
            > Embeddings map each discrete element to a vector (fixed length) of real numbers
        > High-Dimensional Space
            > The vectors exist in a high-dimensional space. (e.g., 100 dimensions, 300 dimensions)
            > This allows for a rich representation of the relationships between the embedded elements
            > i.e.
                > car may have lots of dimensions (i.e. cc, color, wheels number, ...)
        > Learned Representation
            > the assignment of vectors are done based on previous training on huge data
                > i.e.
                    > king and queen are close in the vector space
                    > king and car are far apart 
            > the training process changes the values of the vectors

    > benefits
        > AI knows relationships between elements (it understands them)
            > car is closer to vehicle than to fruit
    
    > how embeddings are created
        > Neural Networks
            > A neural network is a computing system inspired by the structure and function of the human brain
            > uses interconnected nodes (artificial neurons) to solve problems.
