Processes and Threads
    > A process is a running program
    > A processor understands only binary executable code
        > compilers do that work
    > Older computers supported one process at a time
        > today - multiple - at same time

    > Thread
        > is a basic unit of execution in a process
        > each process can have one/more threads

    > Each program running on a computer represents a process
    > It's a top level task that an operating system such as Windows or Linux uses to encapsulate a running program
    > Process contains
        > Code that is running
        > Memory that is allocated to it by the OS
        > Files or sockets that it has open
        > One or more threads running within the process
    > When process exits/crashes
        > OS automatically cleans up resources
            > closes files/sockets
            > returns memory back to the OS
            > shuts-down threads
