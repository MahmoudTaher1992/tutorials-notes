Cluster
  > node js runs on one process (single threaded)
  > to take advantage of other cores you can launch a cluster of node js process
    and distribute load between them
  > it will increase the throughput (requests that can be handled concurrently/second)
  
  > Cluster module enables the creation of child processes (workers) that run 
    simultaneously and share the same server port.
  > Each spawned child has its own event loop, memory, and V8 instance.
  > Having multiple processes to handle incoming requests means that several requests 
    can be processed simultaneously and if there is a long-running/blocking operation on one worker, 
    the other workers can continue handling other incoming requests 

  > if you want to test the performance try using `load testing libraries`
    > `loadtest`

  > Cluster only performs well if there are CPU intensive work to be done (otherwise it may perform bad) 
    > because the rest of the cluster will take care of other requests

  > PM2
    > a process management tool that runs cluster for you
    > handles the load balancing
    > creates another instances to replace of the failed ones
