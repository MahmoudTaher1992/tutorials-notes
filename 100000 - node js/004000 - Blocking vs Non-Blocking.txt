Blocking vs Non-Blocking
    > "I/O" refers primarily to interaction with the system's disk and network supported by libuv.
    > Blocking
        > when the execution of additional JavaScript in the Node.js process must wait 
          until a non-JavaScript operation completes
        > Blocking doesn't refer to intensive CPU operations, it refers to I/O operations
        > All sync operations are blocking methods
            > don't handle errors
        > most of the libraries implement the non-blocking and blocking methods
    > Concurrency
        > Node js is single threaded
        > concurrency refers to the ability of the event loop to execute js cb fns after async tasks are done
        > If a request has an I/O operation that costs 45s 
            > having it in an async will save lot of time
