introduction
    > gradle is a build automation tool
        > takes your code and packages it into a deployable unit
    > written in groovy language (built on top of JVM)
    > highly configurable to meet your project needs
    > makes building and running apps very easy (because it is designed for that purpose)
    > no need for any previous installation (the wrapper will install the gradle for you)
        > ./gradlew build
    > it is fast (because it supports incremental builds)
        > it won't run the tests again if the code has not changed

        > build.gradle
            > groovy script that describes hoe the project is built 
            > lives at the top level of the project

        > tasks
            > defines a unit of work to be executed in your build
                > i.e.
                    > compiling your code
                    > deploy it to remote server
                    > ...executed
            > you can invoke it from the command line
                > i.e.
                    > ./gradlew build
            > see available tasks by
                > ./gradlew tasks
            > you can create your own tasks
            > tasks can have dependencies on another tasks 
                > dependencies get executed first before the target task 

        > wrapper (gradlew)
            > contains a specific version of gradle
            > installs gradle if not installed
            > cross-platform option 
            > always use it

        > settings.gradle
            > file contains project's metadata (name, ...)
