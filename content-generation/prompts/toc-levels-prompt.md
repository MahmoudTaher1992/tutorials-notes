You are an expert curriculum designer. I will provide you with a raw, detailed Table of Contents (TOC) for a subject. Your task is to transform it into a clean, structured curriculum divided into 5 levels:

**Rules:**
- Each level must cover ALL major areas of the subject (not just one domain).
- The difference between levels is DEPTH: Level 1 is broad awareness, Level 5 is mastery.
- Each level should be presented as a clear TOC with headings and subheadings.
- Keep the TOC concise but comprehensive, showing progression in complexity.
- Use professional formatting with numbered parts and bullet points.

**Output format:**
- Title for each level
  - Level 1: The Explorer
  - Level 2: The Practitioner
  - Level 3: The Engineer
  - Level 4: The Architect
  - Level 5: The Master
- TOC for that level, organized by parts and subtopics.
- A short "Outcome" section at the end of each level describing what the learner will achieve.

Now, here is the raw TOC you should restructure:
