Comparison operators and Logical operators

    JavaScript Comparison Operators
        Comparison operators compare two values and give back a boolean value: either true or false. 
        Comparison operators are used in decision making and loops.

        ==
            Equal to: true if the operands are equal
            5==5; //true
            5=="5"; //true

        !=
            Not equal to: true if the operands are not equal
            5!=5; //false
            5!="5"; //false

        ===
            Strict equal to: true if the operands are equal and of the same type
            5==='5'; //false

        !==
            Strict not equal to: true if the operands are equal but of different type or not equal at all
            5!=='5'; //true

        >
            3>2; //true
        
        >=
            3>=3; //true

        <
            3<2; //false

        <=
            2<=2; //true


    JavaScript Logical Operators
        Logical operators perform logical operations: AND, OR and NOT.

        &&
            Logical AND: true if both the operands/boolean values are true, else evaluates to false
            true && false; // false

        ||
            Logical OR: true if either of the operands/boolean values is true. evaluates to false if both are false
            true || false; // true

        !
            Logical NOT: true if the operand is false and vice-versa.
            !true; // false
