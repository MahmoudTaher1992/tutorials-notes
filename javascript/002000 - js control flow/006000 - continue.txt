The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and the control flow of the 
program goes to the next iteration.

Syntax
    continue [label];

continue with for Loop
    Code
        // program to print the value of i
        for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {

            // condition to continue    
            if (i == 3) {
                continue;
            }

            console.log(i);
        }

    Output
        1
        2
        4
        5

continue with while Loop
    In a while loop, continue skips the current iteration and control flow of the program jumps back to the while condition.

    The continue statement works in the same way for while and do...while loops.

continue with Nested Loop
    When continue is used inside of two nested loops, continue skips the current iteration of the inner loop.
