JavaScript Variables
    In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data
    let num = 5;
    Here, num is a variable. It's storing 5.

    JavaScript Declare Variables
        we use either "var" or "let" keyword to declare variables
        var x;
        let y;

        var is function scoped 
        let is block scoped 

    JavaScript Initialize Variables
        We use the assignment operator = to assign a value to a variable.
            let x;
            x = 5;
        You can also initialize variables during its declaration.
            let x = 5;
            let y = 6;
        In JavaScript, it's possible to declare variables in a single statement.
            let x = 5, y = 6, z = 7;

    If you use a variable without initializing it, it will have an undefined value.
        let x; // x is the name of the variable
        console.log(x); // undefined

    Rules for Naming JavaScript Variables
        Variable names must start with either a letter, an underscore _, or the dollar sign $
            //valid
            let a = 'hello';
            let _a = 'hello';
            let $a = 'hello';
        Variable names cannot start with numbers.
            //invalid
            Let 1a = 'hello'; // this gives an error
        JavaScript is case-sensitive. So y and Y are different variables.
            let y = "hi";
            let Y = 5;

            console.log(y); // hi
            console.log(Y); // 5
        Keywords cannot be used as variable names.
            //invalid
            let new = 5; // Error! new is a keyword.

    Notes:
        In JavaScript, the variable names are generally written in camelCase if it has multiple words. 
        For example, firstName, annualSalary
