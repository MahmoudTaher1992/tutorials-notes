Description
This might be the only course where you learn almost every domain of filmmaking.

The thing about this course is that I don’t want to waste your time to learn things that don’t help you, so you will learn everything you need to know to shoot at least just like me. In this course you’ll find how to film weddings, music videos, commercials, and viral cinematics. I’ll also be teaching you the business, networking and the advertising part. Follow the next episode for the mindset you need to have for achiveing higher paid jobs faster than me, because there wasn’t anyone there for me when I started learning this.

Today we live in a day and age where everything is changing. From the cameras we use to shoot, to the software we edit on; filmmaking is constantly evolving. I don’t think you will find anything like this on the web! I've compiled my best tips, tricks, advice, and secrets tha
