Requirements
Must be ready to apply all the incredible knowledge into your own wedding business.
If you don't have a wedding business, this course will help you set one up from the ground up.
You must not be afraid to start, and to go after it. I started with just one simple camera and no connections at all and I've shot over 450 weddings. And I've consistently learned how to make six figures for the past 13 years in the industry.
