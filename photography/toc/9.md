Description
Video production. There are thousands of online video production courses, so why should you enroll in this one? This is the longest, most comprehensive, and most in depth video production course in the world on the specific niche of how to make human beings come across their best when they are speaking on video.

The missing ingredient in so many video productions is having a compelling, interesting, engaging human being speaking. So many courses on video production get lost in the details of lighting, editing software, and the latest technology with video cameras. Of course, all of those things are important, but if all you do is focus on the technology you can still end up with the boring, lifeless, and uninteresting video.

If you are only going to take one video production course, then this should not be your course. But if you’re serious about producing high-quality video then you should take this course in addition to others that cover all the basics of the technical aspects of video production. Frequently,
