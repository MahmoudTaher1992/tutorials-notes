Description
No matter what camera you have, luckily once you learn the basics, it's all the same across the board. So we'll start simple and learn the bare basics. Then slowly evolve to more advanced cameras and settings until you're able to work a cinema camera such as the RED. We learn about lenses, cameras, sensors as well as the best settings to use for any situation.
