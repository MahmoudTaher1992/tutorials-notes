# Mechanical Shutter (12 fps): Pros & Cons

In an era of 40 fps electronic bursts, the **Mechanical Shutter** might seem like a relic. However, on the R6 Mark II, it remains the "Reference Standard" for image quality. Understanding when to revert to this physical mechanism is what separates a casual shooter from a technical master.

### 1. How It Works
The Mechanical Shutter consists of two physical curtains (blades) constructed from carbon fiber or light metal alloys that sit in front of the sensor.
1.  **Front Curtain:** Slides down to cover the sensor (reset) or opens to expose it.
2.  **Rear Curtain:** Chases the front curtain to end the exposure.
3.  **The Sound:** The distinct "Click-Clack" you hear is these blades physically moving. On the R6 Mark II, this mechanism is rated to fire up to **12 frames per second (High Speed Continuous +)**.

### 2. The Primary Advantage: Zero Rolling Shutter
The single most important reason to use the Mechanical Shutter is to eliminate **Rolling Shutter Distortion**.

*   **The Physics:** The mechanical curtains move across the sensor much faster than the sensor can read itself electronically.
*   **The Result:** If you are photographing a golf swing, a baseball bat, a helicopter propeller, or a fast-moving train, the Mechanical Shutter ensures vertical lines stay vertical.
    *   *Comparison:* Even though the R6 Mark II's electronic shutter is fast, it can still bend a golf club. The Mechanical shutter will render it straight.

### 3. Flash Photography Supremacy
For studio and event photographers, the Mechanical Shutter is mandatory.

*   **X-Sync Speed:** The R6 Mark II has a mechanical flash sync speed of roughly **1/200s** (often usable at 1/250s depending on the trigger).
*   **The Issue with Electronic:** If you switch to Electronic Shutter, the sync speed drops drastically (usually around 1/50s) or flash is disabled entirely on many cameras.
*   **High Speed Sync (HSS):** If you need to shoot flash outdoors at 1/8000s, you *must* use the Mechanical (or EFCS) shutter. The fully electronic shutter usually cannot sync with HSS strobes.

### 4. Bokeh and Exposure Uniformity
There is a subtle optical phenomenon that affects wide-aperture lenses (f/1.2, f/1.4).

*   **Electronic First Curtain Issue:** When using "Electronic First Curtain" (the default hybrid mode), the background blur (bokeh) can look "nervous" or chopped off at very high shutter speeds (1/4000s+).
*   **Mechanical Purity:** The Mechanical Shutter ensures that the exposure is physically symmetrical. This renders out-of-focus areas (bokeh balls) perfectly round and smooth. If you paid $2,000 for the RF 50mm f/1.2 L, using the Mechanical Shutter ensures you get the optical look you paid for.

### 5. The Cons (Why not use it always?)
If it's so good, why do we have other modes?

*   **Shutter Shock:** The physical impact of the blades slamming stops creates micro-vibrations. At shutter speeds between 1/60s and 1/4s, this vibration can actually blur the image slightly (reducing sharpness), especially on high-resolution sensors.
*   **Wear and Tear:** It is a mechanical part with a lifespan. The R6 Mark II shutter is durable (likely rated around 300,000 actuations), but every shot brings it closer to death. Electronic shutter is "free" wear-wise.
*   **Blackout:** At 12 fps, the mechanical shutter blocks the sensor repeatedly. You will see a "slide show" effect in the viewfinder rather than a smooth video feed, which makes tracking erratic subjects harder compared to the blackout-free Electronic shutter.
*   **Noise:** It is audible. In a church, on a golf course backswing, or on a film set, the "Clack-Clack-Clack" is unacceptable.

### Summary
**Use the Mechanical Shutter when:**
1.  You are using Flash (Studio or On-Camera).
2.  You are panning extremely fast (Motorsports).
3.  You are shooting subjects with rapid rotational movement (Propellers, Bat swings).
4.  You are shooting wide open (f/1.2) at high noon and want perfect bokeh.

**Avoid it when:**
1.  Silence is required (Weddings, Wildlife).
2.  You need maximum speed (40fps).
3.  You are shooting slow shutter speeds (1/15s) handheld and want to avoid vibration.
