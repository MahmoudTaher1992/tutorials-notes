# AF Case 1: Versatile Multi-Purpose Setting

The Canon R6 Mark II, like the high-end DSLRs before it (1D X series), utilizes a "Case" system to fine-tune how the autofocus algorithm reacts to movement. **Case 1** is the default factory setting, and for many users, it is the only one they will ever need.

### 1. What "Versatile" Means
Case 1 is designed to be the "Jack of all trades." It is balanced precisely in the middle of the spectrum for two critical variables:
*   **Tracking Sensitivity:** How easily does the camera get distracted by obstacles?
*   **Accel./Decel. Tracking:** How fast does the camera expect the subject to change speed?

### 2. The Default Values
If you look at the sliders for Case 1, you will see:
*   **Tracking Sensitivity: 0** (Balanced)
    *   It doesn't let go instantly if a pole passes in front of your subject.
    *   It doesn't hold on forever if your subject leaves the frame.
*   **Accel./Decel. Tracking: 0** (Balanced)
    *   It assumes the subject moves at a relatively constant speed but allows for some minor stopping and starting (like a person jogging or a car driving).

### 3. When to Use Case 1
This is the "Set it and forget it" mode. It is ideal for:
*   **General Photography:** Kids running in the park, pets playing, people walking down the aisle at a wedding.
*   **Predictable Sports:** Marathon runners, cycling, motorsports on a straight track.
*   **Birds in Flight (General):** Large birds gliding or flying in a straight line.

### 4. When Case 1 Fails
Because it is "Balanced," it is not specialized.
*   **Failure Scenario A:** A soccer game where players are constantly crossing in front of each other. Case 1 might accidentally switch focus to the referee running in the foreground because it isn't "sticky" enough. (You need Case 2).
*   **Failure Scenario B:** A motorcycle coming toward you that suddenly brakes hard for a corner. Case 1 assumes constant speed and might overshoot the focus, leaving the bike blurry. (You need Case 4).

### 5. Modification Strategy
You can actually *tweak* Case 1.
*   If you find Case 1 is perfect 90% of the time, but just slightly too jumpy, you can enter the menu and lower the **Tracking Sensitivity to -1**.
*   *Note:* The Case icon (the runner) is just a preset label. You can fundamentally change the math behind it, but it is usually better to switch to the specific Cases (2, 3, 4) designed for those extremes rather than ruining your baseline "Versatile" setting.

### Summary
**Case 1** is the safe harbor.
*   **Start here.** If you are shooting a new sport or subject, use Case 1.
*   **Analyze your failures:** Only switch to Case 2, 3, or 4 if you consistently notice a specific problem (e.g., losing focus to obstacles or missing erratic movements). If your photos are sharp, Case 1 is doing its job.
