# AF Case 3: Instantly Focus on Subjects Entering AF Points

**Case 3** is the polar opposite of Case 2. While Case 2 is "Stubborn," Case 3 is "Hyper-Reactive." It tells the camera to dump its current focus instantly if a new object appears under the active AF point.

### 1. The Core Logic: "Responsive"
The defining characteristic of Case 3 is its **Tracking Sensitivity** setting, which is set to **+1 (Responsive)**.
*   **Behavior:** The moment something new hits the AF point, the camera refocuses on it immediately. It has zero loyalty to the previous subject.
*   **The Scenario:** You are photographing the start of a bicycle race. The peloton is coming toward you. You want to photograph Cyclist A, then Cyclist B behind him, then Cyclist C behind him.
    *   *Case 1/2 Behavior:* The camera would try to hold focus on Cyclist A even as he leaves the frame.
    *   *Case 3 Behavior:* As soon as Cyclist A leaves and Cyclist B enters your center point, the focus snaps instantly to Cyclist B.

### 2. Ideal Use Cases
*   **Start of a Race (Motorsports/Running):** Whenever you have a line of subjects coming head-on and you want to "machine gun" focus from one to the next rapidly.
*   **Alpine Skiing:** The skier pops over a blind crest. You have a split second to grab focus. Case 3 ensures the camera bites onto the skier instantly rather than hesitating.
*   **Erratic Birding (Subject Acquisition):** If you are struggling to even *find* the bird in the viewfinder, Case 3 helps. As soon as you sweep the AF point over the bird, it snaps into focus, helping you identify it.

### 3. The Downside: Twitchy Focus
Case 3 is dangerous in crowded environments.
*   **The Issue:** It has no "Filter."
    *   *Example:* You are shooting a wedding portrait. A waiter walks in front of the couple.
    *   *Result:* The camera instantly focuses on the waiter's back. By the time the waiter leaves, you've missed the couple's expression.
*   **Handheld Stability:** If your hand shakes and the AF point slips off the subject onto the background wall for just a split second, Case 3 will instantly focus on the wall. Case 1 or 2 would have ignored that momentary slip.

### Summary
**Use Case 3 when:**
*   You want to rapidly switch subjects (Target Switching).
*   Subjects appear suddenly in the frame (Alpine Skiing, Skateboarding).
*   You are confident in your ability to keep the AF point on the target.

**Avoid Case 3 when:**
*   There are obstacles (trees, poles, other players) that might cross your path.
*   You have shaky hands or struggle to keep the tracking box on the subject.
