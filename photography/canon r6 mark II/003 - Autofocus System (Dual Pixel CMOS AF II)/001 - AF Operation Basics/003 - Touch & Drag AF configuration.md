# Touch & Drag AF Configuration

For decades, photographers moved focus points using a joystick (Multi-Controller). The R6 Mark II supports this, but it also offers a faster, hybrid method inherited from the EOS M/R series: **Touch & Drag AF**. This feature turns the rear LCD into a laptop trackpad *while* your eye is looking through the viewfinder.

### 1. What is Touch & Drag AF?
Typically, when you look through the EVF, your nose touches the screen, and the touchscreen is disabled to prevent accidental clicks.
*   **The Feature:** Touch & Drag allows you to use your thumb on the dark LCD screen to move the orange AF point in the viewfinder. It feels like moving a mouse cursor.
*   **Speed Advantage:** It is significantly faster than the mechanical joystick. You can jump from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner in a fraction of a second with a quick swipe.

### 2. Enabling and Customizing
Located in **AF Menu (Magenta) > Page 6 > Touch & Drag AF settings**.

*   **Touch & Drag AF:** Set to **Enable**.
*   **Positioning Method:** This is the most critical setting.
    *   **Absolute:** The screen maps 1:1 to the viewfinder. If you touch the top-left of the screen, the point jumps to the top-left.
        *   *Verdict:* Hard to use blindly because you have to guess where your thumb is.
    *   **Relative:** The screen acts like a laptop trackpad. Wherever you touch, swiping right moves the point right.
        *   *Verdict:* **Use Relative.** It is intuitive and allows for precise micro-adjustments without looking at your thumb.

### 3. Active Touch Area (Nose Protection)
The biggest annoyance with Touch & Drag is "Nose Focus"—where your nose touches the screen and moves the focus point to the bottom left corner.
*   **Solution:** You can restrict *which part* of the screen is sensitive to touch.
*   **Settings:**
    *   **Whole Panel:** Entire screen is active (Risky for left-eyed shooters).
    *   **Right: Top / Right: Bottom / Right: Left:** Restricts the touch zone.
*   **Recommendation:** Set **Active Touch Area** to **Right**.
    *   This forces you to reach your thumb slightly across the camera body to the right side of the screen. Since your nose is usually on the left (if you are right-eyed), this physically separates your nose from the active touch zone.

### 4. Sensitivity and Tracking
You can almost treat Touch & Drag as a "Targeting System" for the Subject Tracking AI.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Set AF Method to **Whole Area AF**.
    2.  Look through the EVF.
    3.  See a bird/person the camera hasn't noticed?
    4.  Use Touch & Drag to slide the white tracking box onto that subject.
    5.  Half-press the shutter. The camera "locks" onto that object and tracks it.
*   This is often faster than trying to nudge the joystick repeatedly to catch a moving target.

### 5. When to Disable It
Despite its speed, some professionals turn it off.
*   **Rain/Humidity:** Water droplets on the screen can cause the AF point to jitter wildly.
*   **Gloves:** Thick winter gloves often don't register on capacitive screens (unless they have conductive tips).
*   **Left-Eyed Shooters:** If you look through the viewfinder with your left eye, your nose smashes directly into the "Right" side of the screen, making this feature almost unusable without constant accidental inputs.

### Summary
**Touch & Drag AF** is the modern alternative to the joystick.
*   **Set it to "Relative"** for trackpad-like behavior.
*   **Set area to "Right"** to avoid nose contact.
*   **Use it to "Tag" subjects** for the Tracking system to lock onto.
