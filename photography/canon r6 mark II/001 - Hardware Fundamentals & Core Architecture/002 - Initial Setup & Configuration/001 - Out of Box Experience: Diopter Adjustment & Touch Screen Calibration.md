# Out of Box Experience: Diopter Adjustment & Touch Screen Calibration

The "Out of Box" phase is often rushed, but skipping these specific calibration steps leads to two common frustrations later: believing your lens is broken because the viewfinder looks blurry, or struggling with a touchscreen that feels unresponsive.

### 1. The Diopter Adjustment (The Most Critical Physical Setting)
The **Electronic Viewfinder (EVF)** is a tiny OLED screen that you look at through an eyepiece lens. Everyone’s eyes are different (nearsighted, farsighted, astigmatism). If the eyepiece lens is not calibrated to *your* eye, the camera will look out of focus even when the image is perfectly sharp.

*   **Location:** The Diopter is a small, ridged dial located just to the right of the eyecup, tucked slightly underneath the viewfinder hump. It is small and stiff by design to prevent accidental bumping.
*   **How to Calibrate Correctly:**
    1.  Turn the camera ON and look through the EVF.
    2.  **Do not look at the image.** Do not try to focus on a subject.
    3.  Look at the **Data Overlays** (the shutter speed, aperture numbers, and icons) in the corners or bottom of the screen. These are generated digitally and are always "sharp."
    4.  Rotate the Diopter dial until those *numbers* are crisp and defined.
    5.  *Why this matters:* If you calibrate by looking at a subject, your eye will try to compensate (accommodate), leading to eye strain. If you focus on the digital numbers, you are calibrating the optic to the plane of the screen perfectly.
*   **Consequence of Failure:** If this is set wrong, you will constantly think your Autofocus is failing because the preview looks soft, even though the resulting files are sharp.

### 2. Touch Screen Sensitivity and Calibration
The R6 Mark II uses a **Capacitive** touchscreen (like a smartphone), not a Resistive one (pressure-based). While it doesn't usually require "calibration" of touch points, it does require configuration of **Sensitivity**.

*   **Touch Control Settings:** Found in the **Setup Menu (Red Tab) > Page 4 > Touch Control**.
    *   **Standard:** The default setting. Balanced for bare fingers.
    *   **Sensitive:** Increases the gain of the digitizer.
        *   *Use Case:* If you apply a thick tempered glass screen protector (highly recommended to protect the resale value).
        *   *Use Case:* If you are shooting in cold weather and have dry skin, or are wearing thin capacitive gloves.
    *   **Disable:** Turns off touch entirely. Useful in rain or humid conditions where water droplets might register as "touches" and accidentally change settings.
*   **Beep:** By default, the camera beeps when you touch the screen. Most professionals disable this immediately (**Setup Menu > Beep > Disable**) to maintain silence during events or wildlife shoots.

### 3. Date, Time, and Zone Setup
Upon the very first boot, the camera forces this menu.

*   **Time Zone:** This is the most important setting here. The R6 Mark II syncs with GPS data from smartphones. If your "Home" time zone is set incorrectly, but your phone sends correct GPS coordinates, you may get conflicting metadata.
*   **Video Format (NTSC vs. PAL):**
    *   This is often linked to your region settings.
    *   **NTSC:** Used in North America/Japan (Frame rates: 24p, 30p, 60p).
    *   **PAL:** Used in Europe/Asia (Frame rates: 25p, 50p).
    *   *Warning:* If you cannot find "60p" or "24p" in your video menu, it is because your camera is set to PAL. If you can't find "25p" or "50p," it is set to NTSC. You must switch the Video System mode to see the corresponding frame rates.

### 4. Language
While obvious, ensure the language is correct. If you accidentally set it to a language you cannot read (e.g., Japanese or Chinese), you can navigate back to it blindly:
1.  Press **MENU**.
2.  Go to the **Setup Tab (Wrench Icon)**.
3.  Go to **Page 2**.
4.  It is usually the **first item** on Page 2.

### Summary
These initial mechanical and digital calibrations ensure that the tool is unbiased. The Diopter ensures what you see is true to the screen; the Touch Sensitivity ensures the camera reacts to your intent; and the Region settings ensure your frame rates and metadata align with your workflow.
