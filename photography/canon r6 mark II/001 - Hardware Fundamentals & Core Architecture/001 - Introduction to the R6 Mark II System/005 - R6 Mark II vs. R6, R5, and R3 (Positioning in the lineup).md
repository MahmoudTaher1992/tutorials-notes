# R6 Mark II vs. R6, R5, and R3 (Positioning in the Lineup)

To fully master the R6 Mark II, it is essential to understand what it *is* and what it *is not*. Canon’s lineup is segmented by sensor technology and intended workflow. The R6 Mark II sits in the "Advanced Hybrid" category, borrowing tech from the flagship R3 while consciously avoiding the high-resolution territory of the R5.

### 1. R6 Mark II vs. The Original R6 (The Predecessor)
The jump from Mark I to Mark II is not just a firmware update; it is a fundamental hardware revision addressing the specific complaints of the original.

*   **Resolution:** 20.1 MP (R6) vs. **24.2 MP (R6 II)**.
    *   *Impact:* The R6 used the 1D X Mark III sensor, which was great for low light but low on resolution for cropping. The R6 II’s new sensor offers 20% more resolution without sacrificing high-ISO performance.
*   **Video Endurance:** The R6 was notorious for overheating in 4K.
    *   *Impact:* The R6 II removes the 30-minute record limit and significantly improves thermal management, making it a viable A-camera for long-form interviews, whereas the R6 was strictly a B-camera or clips camera.
*   **Electronic Shutter:** 20 fps (R6) vs. **40 fps (R6 II)**.
    *   *Impact:* The R6 II doubles the speed, making it superior for wildlife/sports, provided the rolling shutter is managed.
*   **Video Crop:** The R6 had a slight crop (1.07x) in 4K 60p. The R6 II does **Full Width 4K 60p**, keeping your wide-angle lenses truly wide.

### 2. R6 Mark II vs. EOS R5 (The High-Res Sibling)
Many users debate between these two. The distinction lies in **Resolution vs. Speed/Workflow**.

*   **Sensor:** 45 MP (R5) vs. **24.2 MP (R6 II)**.
    *   *R5 Advantage:* Incredible cropping ability and 8K video.
    *   *R6 II Advantage:* Smaller file sizes (faster workflow), slightly better ISO performance in extreme low light, and faster electronic burst (40fps vs 20fps on R5).
*   **Storage Media:** CFExpress Type B + SD (R5) vs. **Dual SD UHS-II (R6 II)**.
    *   *R5:* CFExpress is faster and expensive (required for 8K).
    *   *R6 II:* Dual SD is cheaper and offers redundancy (Backup) easily, but SD cards are the bottleneck that prevents the R6 II from recording internal RAW video or clearing the buffer instantly.
*   **Video Philosophy:** The R5 is an 8K/4K 120fps powerhouse but runs hot. The R6 II is a 4K 60p workhorse that runs cooler for longer.

### 3. R6 Mark II vs. EOS R3 (The Flagship)
The R6 Mark II is often called the "Baby R3" because it inherited the R3's autofocus brain, but it lacks the R3's body and sensor speed.

*   **Sensor Tech:** Stacked BSI (R3) vs. **Standard FSI (R6 II)**.
    *   *The Critical Difference:* The R3 reads its sensor incredibly fast (approx 1/200s), virtually eliminating rolling shutter. The R6 II reads at roughly 1/70s.
    *   *Impact:* You can use the electronic shutter on the R3 for *everything* (even flash). On the R6 II, you must be careful with fast panning or artificial lighting (banding).
*   **Ergonomics:** Integrated Vertical Grip (R3) vs. **Standard Body (R6 II)**.
    *   The R3 uses the massive LP-E19 battery for all-day professional sports shooting. The R6 II is compact and lightweight.
*   **Eye Control AF:** The R3 allows you to move the focus point by *looking* at it in the viewfinder. The R6 II does **not** have this hardware; it relies on joystick or touchscreen input.

### 4. Strategic Positioning: The "Sweet Spot"
The R6 Mark II occupies the most versatile spot in the Canon ecosystem:

*   **For Wedding Photographers:** It offers redundancy (Dual Slots) and sufficient resolution (24MP) with better low-light performance than the R5.
*   **For Hybrid Shooters:** It offers the best video features (False Color, Pre-recording, no limits) outside of the Cinema line, without the price of the R5 C.
*   **For Sports/Wildlife Enthusiasts:** It provides the 40fps speed of a flagship camera, democratizing high-speed action photography, provided the user understands the limitations of the electronic shutter.

### Summary Table

| Feature | R6 (Mark I) | **R6 Mark II** | R5 | R3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Megapixels** | 20.1 MP | **24.2 MP** | 45 MP | 24.1 MP |
| **Sensor Type** | FSI CMOS | **FSI CMOS** | FSI CMOS | Stacked BSI |
| **Max E-Shutter** | 20 fps | **40 fps** | 20 fps | 30/195 fps |
| **Video Top Spec** | 4K 60 (Crop) | **4K 60 (Full Width)** | 8K 30 / 4K 120 | 6K 60 RAW |
| **Recording Limit** | 30 Min | **None (6 hrs)** | 30 Min | None |
| **Card Slots** | 2x SD | **2x SD** | 1x CFEx / 1x SD | 1x CFEx / 1x SD |

This positioning defines the R6 Mark II as the "Smart Choice"—the camera that offers 90% of the flagship performance for 50% of the price, assuming 24MP is enough for your output.
