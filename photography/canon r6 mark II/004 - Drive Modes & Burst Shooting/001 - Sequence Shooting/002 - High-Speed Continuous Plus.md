# High-Speed Continuous + (H+)

The Drive Mode icon with the "H+" symbol represents the maximum performance tier of the R6 Mark II. However, unlocking this speed requires meeting a strict checklist of conditions. If just one variable is off, the "H+" icon will flash or disappear, and your speed will throttle down without warning.

### 1. The Speeds
*   **Mechanical Shutter:** Up to **12 fps**.
*   **Electronic 1st Curtain:** Up to **12 fps**.
*   **Electronic Shutter:** Up to **40 fps**.
    *   *Note:* You can also select **20 fps** or **5 fps** in electronic mode via the menu to save card space.

### 2. The "Green" H+ vs. "White" H+ (The Flashing Icon)
Look closely at the H+ icon in the viewfinder.
*   **Green H+:** You are getting the maximum speed (12fps Mechanical).
*   **White H+ (or Flashing):** You are being throttled. You might be getting 9fps or 7fps.
*   **No Icon:** You are in standard continuous mode (<5fps).

### 3. The Checklist: What kills H+ Speed?
To maintain the Green H+ (12fps) in Mechanical/EFCS modes, you must satisfy these conditions:

1.  **Battery Charge:** The battery (LP-E6NH) must have **>60% capacity** (roughly). As the battery drains, the voltage drops, and the mechanical motor slows down to ensure reliability.
    *   *Note:* Using older LP-E6 batteries (from the 60D era) will instantly disable H+.
2.  **Shutter Speed:** Your shutter speed must be **1/1000s or faster** (optimally). If you shoot at 1/125s, the physical time the shutter stays open prevents the camera from cycling 12 times a second.
3.  **Aperture:** Shooting at very small apertures (f/16, f/22) can slow down the burst because the lens iris has to close down and reopen for focus between every shot.
4.  **Temperature:** If the camera is extremely cold (<0°C), the battery voltage sags.
5.  **Anti-Flicker:** As discussed previously, enabling Anti-Flicker purposely delays the shutter to sync with lights, dropping speed to ~8fps.
6.  **Wi-Fi:** Active Wi-Fi communication can sometimes throttle processor throughput.

### 4. Electronic Shutter Considerations (40 fps)
Interestingly, the Electronic Shutter (40fps) is **less** picky than the Mechanical one.
*   Because there are no physical motors to drive, it is less dependent on battery voltage.
*   However, it is strictly dependent on **Shutter Speed**. You cannot shoot 40fps if your shutter speed is 1/30s (math: 1/30s is 33ms. 40fps requires 25ms intervals. It's physically impossible).

### 5. Strategy: Monitoring the Icon
*   **Habit:** Before a critical moment (e.g., the bride kissing, the race starting), glance at the left side of the EVF.
*   **Action:** If the H+ is flashing white:
    *   Check your battery. Swap it if low.
    *   Turn off Anti-Flicker if not needed.
    *   Check if you accidentally set f/22.

### Summary
**High-Speed Continuous +** is a promise, not a guarantee.
*   **Mechanical Max:** 12fps (Requires >60% battery, high shutter speed, Anti-Flicker OFF).
*   **Electronic Max:** 40fps (Requires high shutter speed).
*   **Fallback:** If stability is more important than raw speed, use standard **High-Speed Continuous (H)** which delivers a consistent ~6-8fps regardless of most variables.
