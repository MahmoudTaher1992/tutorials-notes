# Visual Indicators During Blackout-Free Shooting

One of the most disorienting experiences for new mirrorless users is **Blackout-Free Shooting**. When using the Electronic Shutter at 40fps, the R6 Mark II does not "blink." The screen looks like a smooth video feed. This creates a problem: **How do you know if you are actually taking a picture?**

### 1. The Phenomenon
*   **DSLR Experience:** You press the button. The mirror flips up (blackout). The mirror flips down (image returns). The "Clack-Clack-Clack" confirms you are shooting.
*   **R6 Mark II (Electronic) Experience:** You press the button. The screen stays perfectly clear. There is no sound (unless "Electronic Shutter Sound" is enabled).
    *   *Risk:* You might accidentally fill your card with 500 photos of the ground because you didn't realize you were pressing the button. Or, conversely, you might *think* you are shooting but aren't pressing hard enough.

### 2. The Visual Frame Indicator
To solve this, Canon implemented a visual cue.
*   **The Frame:** When the shutter is firing in blackout-free mode, a **pulsing white frame** appears around the very edge of the viewfinder/LCD.
*   **Behavior:** It flickers rapidly to mimic the rhythm of a shutter.
*   **Customization:** You can't really customize this frame (like changing it to red), but you must train your brain to look for it.

### 3. Electronic Shutter Sound (Auditory Feedback)
Located in **Shoot Menu (Red) > Page 7 > Shutter Mode > Electronic > Volume**.
*   **The Feature:** The camera plays a fake shutter sound through a tiny speaker on the body.
*   **Volume:** Configurable (0-5).
*   **Use Case:**
    *   **Portraits:** Essential. The model needs to hear the click to know when to change poses.
    *   **Sports:** Useful for the photographer to confirm timing.
    *   **Stealth:** Turn volume to 0 for weddings or golf.
*   **Note:** This sound is *not* recorded on video, but be careful in quiet venues—it can be surprisingly loud at max volume.

### 4. Rec. Review (Image Review)
Another indicator is seeing the photo you just took.
*   **Shoot Menu > Page 1 > Image Review**.
*   **Setting:**
    *   **Off:** Best for 40fps action. The stream stays live.
    *   **2 sec / Hold:** Terrible for action. After the burst, the camera freezes the last frame on screen, preventing you from seeing the action continuing.
*   **Recommendation:** Always set Image Review to **OFF** when shooting High-Speed bursts. Rely on the white frame indicator to know you are shooting.

### Summary
*   **Train your eye** to spot the flickering white border in the EVF.
*   **Enable the fake shutter sound** (low volume) if you need rhythmic confirmation.
*   **Disable Image Review** to maintain a truly uninterrupted view of reality.
