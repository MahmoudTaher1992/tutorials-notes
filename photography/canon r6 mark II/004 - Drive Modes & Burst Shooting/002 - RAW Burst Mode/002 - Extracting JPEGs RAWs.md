# RAW Burst Mode: Extracting JPEGs/RAWs from the "Roll"

The major trade-off of using the **RAW Burst Mode** (with Pre-Shooting) is the workflow. Unlike standard shooting, where you get 100 individual image files, this mode produces a single **Container File** that appears as one icon on your computer. You must "extract" the images you want to keep.

### 1. The Container Concept
If you shoot a burst of 50 images in RAW Burst Mode, the SD card will show **one file** (e.g., `IMG_001.CR3`).
*   **File Size:** It will be massive (e.g., 600MB+).
*   **Visibility:** Most standard image viewers (Windows Photos, older MacOS Preview) cannot "play" this file like a video. They might only show the first frame.

### 2. Extraction Method A: In-Camera (The Fastest Way)
You can unpack the photos directly on the back of the camera.
1.  Press **Play**.
2.  Navigate to the RAW Burst file (identified by a special "Stack" icon).
3.  Press **SET** (or tap the icon).
4.  The camera opens a playback interface where you can scroll through the 50 frames like a movie.
5.  **Select:** Find the perfect frame (e.g., the bird taking off).
6.  **Extract:** Press **SET** -> **Extract as JPEG** (for speed) or **Extract as RAW** (for editing).
7.  **Result:** The camera creates a *new*, separate file on the SD card for that specific image.

### 3. Extraction Method B: Canon DPP (The Desktop Way)
If you want to do this on a computer, you *must* use **Canon Digital Photo Professional (DPP)** software.
*   **Adobe Lightroom / Photoshop:** As of early 2024, Adobe usually supports the *first frame* of the roll but typically does not offer a native, elegant tool to scrub through the proprietary roll structure to find frame #27.
*   **The Workflow:**
    1.  Import the large .CR3 roll into Canon DPP.
    2.  Use the "RAW Burst Image Tool."
    3.  Mark the frames you want.
    4.  Batch extract them as individual .CR3 or .JPG files.
    5.  Import those extracted files into Lightroom.

### 4. Why is this annoying?
This proprietary workflow is the main reason pros don't use RAW Burst Mode for *everything*.
*   It adds a massive friction step to the post-production process.
*   If you shoot 1,000 bursts, you have to manually extract the "Keepers" from 1,000 container files before you can even start editing in Lightroom.

### Summary
*   **Don't panic** when you only see one file on your card. The photos are inside.
*   **In-Camera Extraction** is best for casual use (extract the 1 good shot, delete the rest).
*   **Canon DPP** is required for batch processing.
*   **Know the cost:** The time you save capturing the "impossible moment" (Pre-Shooting) is paid back in the time you spend extracting the file later.
