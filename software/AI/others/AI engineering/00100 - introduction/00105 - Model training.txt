Model training
    > is the process of teaching a machine learning model to make accurate predictions or decisions by feeding it large amounts of data
    > learning types
        > Supervised learning
            > the model is trained on labeled data
            > the output is known, like image recognition
        > Unsupervised learning
            > the model is trained on unlabeled data
            > the output is unknown
        > Reinforcement learning
            > the model learns by interacting with an environment
            > the model receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties
            > the model learns to maximize rewards and minimize penalties

        > Data collection
        > Data preprocessing
        > Model selection
            > choose the appropriate machine learning algorithm for the task
        > Model training
            > Feeding the data into the model and adjusting the model's parameters to minimize errors
        > Model evaluation
            > Assessing the model's performance on a separate dataset
        > Hyperparameter Tuning
        > Testing
