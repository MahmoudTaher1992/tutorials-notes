└── Authentication & Authorization Concepts
    ├── 1. Foundational Web Authentication Mechanisms
    │   ├── A. Basic Authentication
    │   │   ├── i. How it Works: Base64 encoding of "username:password" in the Authorization header.
    │   │   ├── ii. State: Stateless.
    │   │   ├── iii. Pros: Very simple to implement.
    │   │   └── iv. Cons: Insecure (sends credentials with every request), not flexible.
    │   ├── B. Cookie-Based Authentication (Stateful)
    │   │   ├── i. How it Works: Server creates a session on login and sends a session ID cookie to the browser.
    │   │   ├── ii. State: Stateful (server must store session data).
    │   │   ├── iii. Use Case: Traditional monolithic web applications.
    │   │   └── iv. Challenges: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), scaling issues, not ideal for mobile/SPAs.
    │   └── C. Token-Based Authentication (Stateless)
    │       ├── i. How it Works: Server issues a signed token (e.g., JWT) which the client stores and sends with requests.
    │       ├── ii. State: Stateless (server doesn't need to store token data).
    │       ├── iii. Use Case: Modern APIs, Single Page Applications (SPAs), mobile apps.
    │       └── iv. Core Component: The Token Itself
    │           └── ● JWT (JSON Web Token)
    │               ├── a. Purpose: A standard for creating self-contained access tokens that assert claims.
    │               ├── b. Structure
    │               │   ├── 1. Header: Algorithm & Token Type.
    │               │   ├── 2. Payload: Claims (user info, permissions, expiration).
    │               │   └── 3. Signature: To verify the token's integrity.
    │               └── c. Role: It's the "what" - the format of the token used in many modern systems.
    │
    ├── 2. Authorization Frameworks (Delegation)
    │   └── A. OAuth 2.0
    │       ├── i. Core Purpose: Delegated Authorization, not Authentication. Allows an application to act on a user's behalf.
    │       ├── ii. Key Roles
    │       │   ├── 1. Resource Owner: The User.
    │       │   ├── 2. Client: The application requesting access.
    │       │   ├── 3. Authorization Server: Issues the tokens.
    │       │   └── 4. Resource Server: The API that holds the data.
    │       ├── iii. The Flow: User grants permission, application gets an "Access Token".
    │       └── iv. Role: It's the "how" - a protocol for getting access tokens securely.
    │
    └── 3. Single Sign-On (SSO) & Federated Identity Protocols
        ├── A. Core Concept of SSO: Log in once to an Identity Provider (IdP) to access multiple independent Service Providers (SPs).
        ├── B. SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language)
        │   ├── i. Purpose: An XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data.
        │   ├── ii. How it Works: User is redirected between the SP and IdP; the IdP sends a signed XML "SAML Assertion" to the SP.
        │   ├── iii. Common Use Case: Enterprise and corporate environments (e.g., logging into Salesforce with your company credentials).
        │   └── iv. Role: A robust, mature protocol for implementing SSO, primarily in B2B contexts.
        └── C. OIDC (OpenID Connect)
            ├── i. Purpose: An identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework.
            ├── ii. How it Works: It extends OAuth 2.0 flows to provide an "ID Token" (which is a JWT) in addition to the Access Token.
            ├── iii. The ID Token: Its primary purpose is to prove the user's identity and provide basic profile information.
            ├── iv. Relationship to OAuth: OIDC uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization and adds the identity piece. "OAuth is for getting access, OIDC is for proving who you are."
            └── v. Common Use Case: Modern consumer applications (e.g., "Sign in with Google/Facebook").
