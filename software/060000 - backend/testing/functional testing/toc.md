Of course. Here is a detailed Table of Contents for studying Functional Testing, mirroring the structure and depth of the provided REST API TOC.

Functional testing ensures software meets its specified functional requirements. It's a black-box testing methodology where testers provide inputs and verify the outputs against expected results without needing knowledge of the application's internal source code. This discipline is foundational to quality assurance and stands in contrast to non-functional testing, which assesses aspects like performance, security, and usability.
