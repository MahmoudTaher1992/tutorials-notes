Of course! This is an excellent request. A well-structured learning path is key.

Here is a detailed Table of Contents for studying Unit Testing, structured with a similar depth and logical progression as your REST API example. It moves from the foundational "why" and "what" to the practical "how," and then into advanced strategies and architectural considerations.
