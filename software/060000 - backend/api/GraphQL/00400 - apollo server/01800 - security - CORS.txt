Security - CORS
    > CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
        > it is an HTTP-header-based protocol that enables a server to dictate which origins can access its resources
        > in another way your server can specify which websites can talk to it on which HTTP method

    > Why use CORS ?
        > CORS error arise when you try to send an API call from a client to a server (on different host/domain)

        > background context
            > internet users should be careful when installing software on their devices (sites should be trusted)
            > when it comes to internet browsing, all the time lots of data is loaded from different servers, so the risk is much more higher
            > we should be careful from the users while they are calling our server (while they are visiting another websites)
            > Browser's security mechanisms (CORS, SOP, ...etc) adds a protection by
                > specifying which browsers' origins can request resources from the server
                > origin is
                    > protocol + domain + port
            > SOP
                > stands for Same Origin Policy
                > restricts scripts from one origin from accessing resources from another origin
                > no one else outside the origin can access resources
                > but this policy is too much restricted (and here comes the value of CORS)

            > CORS
                > allows to share resources across different origins
                > enables servers to specify which external clients access their resources

    > CORS settings
        > you can setup CORS to
            > control which origins can access server resources
            > control whether to accept cookies with the requests or not

    > CORS uses  Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP header as a part of it's protocol
        > it guides the server on which origins can access the resources

    > Any app on private network server MUST specify specific origins for CORS (security issue)

    > in order to allow cross-origin cookies you must specify origins for your CORS configurations

    > in production you have to specify origins for CORS, it is really dangerous out there !!!

    > That's why the browsers send a preflight OPTIONS request to the server before sending the original request
        > it asks about if it is allowed to send the request in terms of CORS
        > if allowed it will send the original request
