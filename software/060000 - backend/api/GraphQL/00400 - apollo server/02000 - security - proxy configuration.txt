Security - Proxy Configuration
    > try to understand what http proxy is in graphql and node.js
    
    > agent is an object in node js that manages the connections to another hosts
        > instead of opening a new connection to another host each time a request is sent, agent takes the responsibility of managing the connections so that
            > it is used multiple times before closed (if applicable)
            > it can keep the connection alive as long as the agent is alive and use it over and over
        > it is a performance player

        > manages the connections for the HTTP clients
            > it means that it serves axios

        > http.request(), http.get() makes a request to another servers from node.js 
            > they use agent (connections manager)
            > they use http.globalAgent (used by default if no custom agent is supplied)

    > GraphQL will need to make requests to outside servers
        > requests go through http and then to the globalAgent
        > you might want to configure the globalAgent and here is how you do it

    > you can configure it through https.globalAgent directly but it is recommended to use global-agent package
        > it lets you configure the globalAgent through environment variables (which is not supported by node js)

    > Depending on the deployment environment (e.g. AWS, Heroku, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.), environment variables may be set differently

    > you can also configure a custom SSL/TLS certificate
