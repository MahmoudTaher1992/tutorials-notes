Performance - cache backends
    > if you want to handle the cache you can pass the cache handler to the apollo server

    > cache handlers examples
        > InMemoryLRUCache
        > KeyvAdapter
        > Redis
        > Keyv

    > any cache should always be bounded (has size limit), otherwise attackers can exhaust the memory and may cause server's crash

    > you can use `Keyv` as an ORM to the caching services i.e. (Redis, Memcached, ... etc)

    > you can implement your own cache by implementing KeyValueCache interface

    > you can configure redis/Memcache to be your cache
