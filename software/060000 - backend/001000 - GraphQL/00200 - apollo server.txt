Apollo server
    > responsibilities
        > receive graphQL queries from the client
            > apollo-server can receive any query from any graphQL client (not just apollo-client)
        > validate the query against the schema
        > populate the schema fields
        > return the response

    > apollo server is one easily way to handle those things but you can handle it yourself the hard way

    > can populate mock data for you
        > you can set it in the server config or a new way in the new versions
        > you can customize the mock the way you want
