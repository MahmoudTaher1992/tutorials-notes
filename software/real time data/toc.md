*   **Part II: Core Real-Time Technologies & Protocols (Deep Dive)**
    *   **A. Polling Techniques (Client-Pull)**
        *   **Short Polling:**
            *   Mechanism: Repeated, fixed-interval requests (`setInterval`)
            *   Pros: Simple to implement, stateless server
            *   Cons: High latency, inefficient (wasted requests), network overhead
        *   **Long Polling (Comet):**
            *   Mechanism: Client sends a request, server holds it open until data is available
            *   Connection Lifecycle: Request -> Wait -> Respond -> Repeat
            *   Pros: Lower latency than short polling
            *   Cons: Server resource consumption (holding connections), message ordering complexities
    *   **B. Server-Sent Events (SSE) (Unidirectional Server-Push)**
        *   **Protocol Details:**
            *   The `text/event-stream` MIME Type
            *   The `EventSource` API on the Client
            *   Message Format: `data:`, `id:`, `event:`, `retry:`
        *   **Connection Lifecycle & Features:**
            *   Initial HTTP Handshake
            *   Automatic Reconnection & State Management (with `Last-Event-ID`)
            *   Server-to-Client Keep-Alives
        *   **When to Use SSE:**
            *   Pros: Simple, uses standard HTTP, built-in error handling & reconnection
            *   Cons: Unidirectional only, browser connection limits (typically 6 per domain)
            *   Ideal Use Cases: News feeds, stock tickers, status updates, push notifications
    *   **C. WebSockets (Bidirectional, Full-Duplex)**
        *   **Protocol Details:**
            *   The `ws://` and `wss://` Schemes
            *   The HTTP `Upgrade` Handshake (Switching Protocols from HTTP to WebSocket)
            *   WebSocket Frames: Text, Binary, Ping/Pong, Close
        *   **The WebSocket API:**
            *   The `WebSocket` Object in JavaScript
            *   Events: `onopen`, `onmessage`, `onerror`, `onclose`
            *   Methods: `send()`, `close()`
        *   **When to Use WebSockets:**
            *   Pros: Lowest latency, bidirectional, efficient protocol
            *   Cons: More complex, requires dedicated server support, potential proxy/firewall issues
            *   Ideal Use Cases: Chat applications, multiplayer games, collaborative editing, high-frequency data streaming
