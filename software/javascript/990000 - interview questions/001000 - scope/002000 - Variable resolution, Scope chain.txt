Variable resolution
    > js will look for the variable in the current scope
    > if not found it will go the parent scope
    > if not found it will go another level up and does that till
        > either find the variable
        > or reach the global scope
    > if not found in the global scope
        > it throws error 'var-name is not defined'

Scope chain
    > unique scopes from the variable got called to the global scope
    > is the way how a js looks for variables, it starts with the inner scope > then outer scope >
      and goes up till it reaches to the global scope > otherwise it throws an error
