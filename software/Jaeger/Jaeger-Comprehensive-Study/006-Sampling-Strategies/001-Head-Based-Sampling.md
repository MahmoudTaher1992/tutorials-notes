# Head-Based Sampling (Decision at start)

- **Constant**: Sample everything (100%) or nothing
- **Probabilistic**: Sample a percentage (e.g., 0.1%)
- **Rate Limiting**: Bucketed token approach (e.g., 10 traces/sec per service)
- **Guaranteed Throughput**: Combination of Probabilistic and Lower bound
