## Part III: Advanced HCL & Dynamic Configurations
### A. Dynamic Infrastructure
- Conditional Expressions (`condition ? true_val : false_val`)

### B. Dynamic Blocks
- Creating Repeatable Nested Blocks within a Resource
- Use Cases: Security Group Rules, Load Balancer Listeners, etc.
- Combining Dynamic Blocks with `for_each`
### C. Expressions and Functions
- Advanced Function Usage (e.g., `fileset`, `zipmap`, `try`, `can`)
- Working with Complex Data Structures (nested maps, lists of objects)
- Type Conversion Functions
- Version Constraints for Providers and Modules (`~>`, `>=`, etc.)

## Part IV: Managing State
### A. Terraform State Deep Dive

- Using Terragrunt for DRY Configurations and Remote State Management

## Part VII: Providers In-Depth
### A. Provider Fundamentals
