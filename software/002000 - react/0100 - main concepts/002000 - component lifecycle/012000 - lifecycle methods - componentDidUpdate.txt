React Lifecycle Methods
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)
        Invoked immediately after updating occurs.

        Use this as an opportunity to operate on the DOM when the component has been updated. 
        
        This is also a good place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props 
        (e.g. a network request may not be necessary if the props have not changed).

        You may call setState() immediately in componentDidUpdate() but note that it must be wrapped in a condition, 
        or you’ll cause an infinite loop

        If your component implements the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() lifecycle (which is rare), the value it returns will be passed 
        as a third “snapshot” parameter to componentDidUpdate().
