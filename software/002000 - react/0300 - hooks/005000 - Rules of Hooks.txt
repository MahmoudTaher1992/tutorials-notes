Rules of Hooks
    > Only Call Hooks at the Top Level
        > Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
        > By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders.

    > Only Call Hooks from React Functions or from custom Hooks
    > add eslint-plugin-react-hooks to check those rules 4 u
