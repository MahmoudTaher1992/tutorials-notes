Perfect — I see you want a **Dynatrace study roadmap** with the same level of depth and structure as your React TOC. Dynatrace is a full-stack observability and application performance monitoring (APM) platform, so the TOC will cover fundamentals, instrumentation, monitoring domains, advanced features, integrations, and operational practices. Here’s a **Comprehensive Study Table of Contents for Dynatrace**, modeled after your React example:

This mirrors the **granularity of your React TOC**, but tailored to Dynatrace’s ecosystem: fundamentals, instrumentation, monitoring domains, AI-driven analysis, integrations, and governance.  

Would you like me to **expand this into a study roadmap** (with recommended order, resources, and practice labs), so it’s not just a TOC but a **step-by-step learning plan**?
