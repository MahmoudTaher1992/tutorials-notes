  - `rmdir`: Removing empty directories
- **Copying, Moving, and Renaming**
  - `cp`: Copying files and directories (`-r` for recursive)
  - `mv`: Moving and renaming files and directories
- **Links: Soft Links vs. Hard Links**
  - `ln`: Creating links
  - Conceptual Differences (Inodes, Cross-filesystem)
  - Use cases for each type of link
- **Archiving and Compressing**
  - `tar`: The Tape Archive utility
    - Creating archives (`-c`)
    - Listing contents (`-t`)
    - Extracting archives (`-x`)

  - Combining `tar` with compression (e.g., `.tar.gz`, `.tar.bz2`)
