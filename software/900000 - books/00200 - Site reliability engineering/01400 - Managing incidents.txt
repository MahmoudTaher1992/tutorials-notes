Managing incidents
    > effective incident management is the key to limit the disruption caused by incidents and to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible. 
    
    > Unmanaged incidents
    
    > Anatomy of an Unmanaged Incident
        > Sharp focus on the technical problem
        > poor communication
        > freelancing

    > Elements of Incident Management Process
        > Recursive Separation of Responsibilities
            > it important that everyone in the incident knows his role and doesn't interfere with the others
            > if a member is overloaded, he can ask planning for more staff to delegate work to
            > distinct roles
                > incident command
                    > holds the high level state of the incident
                    > assigns responsibilities according to needs and priorities
                    > holds all un delegated positions 
                    > resolve blockages

                > operational work
                    > works with the incident commander
                    > works on the technical problem
                    > operational team should be the only group modifying the system

                > communication
                    > the public face of incident management team
                    > issues periodic updates to the stakeholders and the incident response team
                    > keeps the incident commander informed of the situation
                    > keeps the incident document accurate and up to date

                > planning
                    > deals with longer term issues
                        > i.e.
                            > filing bugs
                            > ordering dinner
                            > arranging handoffs
                            > tracking the changes done through the incident to resolve it after

        > A Recognized Command Post
            > interested parties should know how to contact the incident commander
            > some teams like to have the team at one place "war room", and others prefer to work in their offices and communicate via emails or IRC

        > Live incident state document
            > Keeping a living incident document is the most important responsibility of the incident commander
            > should be editable by multiple people at the same time (google docs, ...)
        
        > Clear and live handoff
            > the incident commander handoff should be clear
            > the new incident commander should be briefed on the current state of the incident
            > the handoff should be done explicitly
                > i.e.
                    > say "you are now the incident commander, okay ?"
            > Prev incident commander should not leave until he gets a clear acknowledgment that the new incident commander is in charge
            > the handoff should be communicated to the rest of the team
        
    > A managed incident
    
    > When to declare an incident
        > it is better to declare an incident early and fix it quickly than to wait and let it grow
        > set clear conditions for declaring an incident
            > i.e.
                > if you need to involve another team to help
                > if the outage is visible to the customers
                > if the issue is not solved in a certain time frame, even after deep investigation

        > To keep the engineers's incident management skills up to date
            > try to have a regular incident management training
            > mock incidents
            > use similar tools and procedures as in another procedures

        > Trust
            > give permissions to all incident participants
        > introspect
            > if you feel overwhelmed, ask for help

            > make the team members play different roles in the incident management process each incident
