JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape

It was originally going to be called LiveScript, but it was renamed in an ill-fated marketing decision that 
attempted to capitalize on the popularity of Sun Microsystem's Java language â€” 
despite the two having very little in common. This has been a source of confusion ever since

Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. 
It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, 
and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world.
