Prototypes
    are object that is attached to new instances from the class > have shared variables and methods among all 
    instances from the same class

    changing the prototype object doesn't affect old created instances

    If the value is not present in the instance > js looks in the prototype

    i.e.
        function Person(name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        Person.prototype = { age: 24 };
        let omar = new Person("omar");
        console.log(omar.age); // 24

        Person.prototype = { age: 30 };
        let taher = new Person("taher");
        console.log(omar.age); // 24
        console.log(taher.age); // 30
