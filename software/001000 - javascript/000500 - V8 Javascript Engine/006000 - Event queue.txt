Event/Callback/Task queue
    > A data structure that stores the callbacks in a queue
    > A web api adds callbacks to this queue 
    > Event loop looks at the call-stack all the times
        > Once it founds that the call stack is empty
        > It takes a call back from the event-queue and puts it in the call stack
        > It does that till the event queue is empty
