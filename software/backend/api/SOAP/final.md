Of course. This is an excellent request. The key is to map the core concepts and principles from the REST world to their equivalents or counterparts in the SOAP and Web Services (WS-*) ecosystem.

Where REST is centered around *Resources* and a *Uniform Interface*, SOAP is centered around *Operations* and a formal *Contract* (WSDL).

Here is a detailed Table of Contents for studying SOAP APIs, structured identically to your REST example:
