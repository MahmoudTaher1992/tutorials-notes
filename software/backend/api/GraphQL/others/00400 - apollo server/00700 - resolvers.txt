Resolvers
    > apollo server needs to know how to populate the data for every field in the schema so it can respond to requests
    > it does that by the resolvers
    
    > a resolver is a function that is responsible for populating data for a single field in the schema
        > you can use it to get the data from anywhere

    > resolver map
        > is an object that have props named with all graphql object types
        > each prop of them is an object with props of graphql fields
        > the values of those nested props are functions that return the values of those fields
        > it is then passed to apollo server

        > i.e.

            const schema = `
                type Author {
                    name: String!
                    age: Int!
                }

                type Book {
                    id: Int!
                    title: String!
                    author: Author!
                }

                type Query {
                    allBooks: [Book!]!
                }
            `

            const resolvers = {
                Book: {
                    author: (parent, args, context, info) => {
                        return this.authors.filter((author) => author.id === args.id)
                    }
                }

                Query: {

                    ]

            }

    > resolver parameters
        > parent
            > is the returned value from the parent's resolver
            > in author field you will get the Book
            > in allBooks the parent will be the value from rootValue function passed to ApolloServer

        > args
            > an object containing the arguments of the field
        
        > contextValue
            > is a sharable object among all resolvers
            > resolvers should not change the context to ensure consistency among all other resolvers
            > i.e.
                > data loaders
                > connectors
                > authentication info

        > info
            > contains information about the operation's execution state
            > i.e.
                > field name

    > resolver chain
        > graphql resolves the root field and return objects
        > for each object graphql will try to resolve all the fields inside it
        > and that is done till all the result match the query graph
        > each resolver will get the result of the prev resolver in the parameter `parent`

    > resolver return values
        > scalar/object
        > array
        > null/undefined
            > an error will be thrown if the field is not nullable
        > promise
        
    > default resolvers
        > if a field don't have a resolver in the resolvers map
        > a default resolver will be called
            > it will search for the value in the `parent` parameter
                > it can be a function or a value
            > otherwise it will throw

    > performance
        > you can monitor the performance for all your fields in the schema through integrating it with apollo-studio
