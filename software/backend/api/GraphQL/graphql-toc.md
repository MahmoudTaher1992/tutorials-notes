*   **Object Types and Fields:** Defining the structure of your data with fields that have their own types.
*   **Arguments:** How to pass arguments to fields in your schema.
*   **Enums:** Defining a restricted set of possible values for a field.
*   **Lists and Non-Null:** Specifying that a field can return a list of items or that a field cannot be null.
*   **Interfaces:** Defining a common set of fields that multiple object types can implement.
*   **Unions:** Specifying that a field can return one of several object types.
*   **Input Objects:** Defining complex objects to be used as arguments for mutations.

### C. Schema Design Best Practices

*   **Schema Organization:** Strategies for structuring and modularizing your schema for maintainability.
*   **Documentation:** The importance of adding descriptions to your schema for better developer experience.

## Part III: GraphQL Queries

### A. Fundamentals of Queries
*   **What are Queries?** The read-only operations in GraphQL used to fetch data.
*   **Fields:** The specific pieces of data you want to retrieve.
*   **Arguments:** Filtering and specifying the data you want to receive.
*   **Aliases:** Renaming the result of a field in your query.
*   **Operation Name:** Naming your queries for better debugging and logging.
*   **Variables:** Passing dynamic values into your queries.

### B. Advanced Querying Techniques
*   **Fragments:** Reusing common sets of fields in multiple queries.
*   **Inline Fragments:** Querying fields on a specific type within a union or interface.
*   **Directives:** Conditionally including or skipping fields in your query (`@include`, `@skip`).
*   **Meta Fields:** Using `__typename` to determine the type of an object.

## Part IV: GraphQL Mutations

### A. Introduction to Mutations
*   **What are Mutations?** The write operations in GraphQL used to create, update, or delete data.
*   **Defining Mutations in the Schema:** How to structure mutation fields and their arguments.
*   **Operation Name:** The importance of naming mutations for clarity.

### B. Mutation Design Patterns
*   **Multiple Fields in a Mutation:** Performing several data modifications in a single mutation.
*   **Input Types for Mutations:** Using input objects to pass complex data to mutations.
*   **Returning Data from Mutations:** Best practices for what data to return after a mutation is executed.

## Part V: GraphQL Subscriptions

### A. Real-time with Subscriptions
*   **What are Subscriptions?** A way to receive real-time updates from the server.
*   **Event-Based Subscriptions:** The underlying publish-subscribe mechanism.
*   **Defining Subscriptions in the Schema:** How to structure subscription fields.

### B. Transporting Subscriptions
*   **GraphQL Over WebSockets:** The most common protocol for handling subscriptions.
*   **GraphQL Over SSE (Server-Sent Events):** An alternative transport for real-time updates.
*   **Live Queries:** A different approach to real-time data, often compared with subscriptions.
*   **@defer / @stream directives:** Incrementally delivering parts of a query result.

## Part VI: GraphQL Server Development

### A. The Role of the Server
*   **Execution:** The process of parsing, validating, and executing a GraphQL request.
*   **Resolvers:** The functions that are responsible for fetching the data for a single field in the schema.
*   **Synchronous and Asynchronous Resolvers:** Handling both immediate and promise-based data fetching.

### B. Building a GraphQL Server
*   **Choosing a Language and Framework:**
    *   **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Apollo Server, GraphQL Yoga, Mercurius.
    *   **Java:** GraphQL Java.
    *   **Python:** Graphene, Ariadne.
    *   **Go:** gqlgen, graphql-go.
*   **Schema-First vs. Code-First Development:** Two different approaches to building your schema.

*   **Error Handling:** Best practices for reporting and managing errors.
*   **Caching:** Techniques for improving performance with server-side caching.
*   **Batching and the DataLoader Pattern:** Solving the N+1 query problem.
