# CRUD Operations

*   **i. POST (Create):** Handling ID generation and conflict errors (409 Conflict).
*   **ii. PUT (Replace) vs. PATCH (Update):**
    *   *The Complexity of PATCH:* Partial modifications (e.g., "Add this specific user to the members array, but don't touch the others").
*   **iii. DELETE (De-provision):** Soft Delete (setting `active: false`) vs. Hard Delete.
