# The SOLID Principles

- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have one reason to change.
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Open for extension, closed for modification.
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
