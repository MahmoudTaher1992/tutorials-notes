# Fundamental Quality Metrics

- **Cohesion**: The degree to which elements inside a module belong together (High Cohesion is good)
- **Coupling**: The measure of dependency between modules (Low Coupling is good)
- Connascence: A Deeper Look at Coupling (Name, Type, Value, Position, etc.)
- Cyclomatic Complexity: Measuring Code Complexity and Testability
