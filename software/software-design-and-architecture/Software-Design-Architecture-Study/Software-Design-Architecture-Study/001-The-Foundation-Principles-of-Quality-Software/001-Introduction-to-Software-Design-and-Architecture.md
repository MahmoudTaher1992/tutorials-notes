# Introduction to Software Design & Architecture

- The "Why": The Cost of Poor Architecture (Complexity, Rigidity, Fragility)
- Design vs. Architecture: Scope and Abstraction Levels
- Key Goals of Good Architecture: Maintainability, Scalability, Reliability, Evolvability
- The Role of the Software Architect
- The Inevitability of Trade-offs (e.g., Consistency vs. Availability, Performance vs. Cost)
