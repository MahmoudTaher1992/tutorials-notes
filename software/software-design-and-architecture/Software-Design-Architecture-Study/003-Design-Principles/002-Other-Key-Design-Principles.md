# Other Key Design Principles

- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid
- **YAGNI**: You Ain't Gonna Need It
- Composition over Inheritance: Favoring flexibility (has-a over is-a)
- Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge): Talk only to your immediate friends.
- Tell, Don't Ask: Don't query an object for state and then act on it; tell the object what to do.
