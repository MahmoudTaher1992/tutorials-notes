Absolutely! Here is a **detailed Table of Contents (TOC) for "Module Bundlers: Focus on SWC"**, modeled after your REST API example, reflecting both broad concepts and deep technical/architectural details. You can adapt or extend sections for Rollup, Webpack, Vite, or esbuild if needed.

### Notes:

- This list is *specific* to SWC but provides general context on module bundlers so you can adapt/compare, and see where SWC fits in the ecosystem.
- Each heading can be expanded into its own, detailed study area (just like in your REST API TOC).
- Let me know if you want similar depth for broader module bundler concepts (e.g. Webpack, Rollup, esbuild) or for a comparison module.

If you want this in a less or more detailed form (or focused on a different aspect), just say so!
