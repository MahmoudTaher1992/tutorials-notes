Conceptual Modeling
6.1. The Entity-Relationship (ER) Model
6.1.1. Core Constructs: Entities, Attributes, Relationships
6.1.2. Attribute Types: Simple, Composite, Multi-valued, Derived
6.1.3. Relationship Constraints: Degree, Cardinality, and Participation
6.1.4. Weak Entity Types and Identifying Relationships
6.1.5. ER Diagram Notations (Chen, Crow's Foot)
6.2. The Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Model
6.2.1. Specialization and Generalization
6.2.2. Superclasses, Subclasses, and Attribute Inheritance
6.2.3. Constraints on Specialization (Disjoint, Overlap, Total, Partial)
6.2.4. Aggregation, Composition, and Categories (UNION Types)
6.3. Modeling with UML Class Diagrams
