# ACID

* they are principles

* Atomicity
    * All or nothing
    * either make all the steps in the change, or nothing
    * under the hood
        * the database keeps logs of the changes
        * if something went wrong, it reverses the partial actions done

* Consistency   
    * Rule follower
    * The database rules are always valid, at any point in time

* Isolation
    * each transaction should be done in isolation from other transactions
    * isolation levels
        * read uncommitted
            * lowest level of isolation
            * it reads the un committed write
            * dirty reads
        * read committed 
            * read only the committed writes
            * prevents dirty reads
        * repeatable read
            * guaranties that if you read data multiple times through the transaction, you will get the same data 
            * this adds a lock to writes while you are executing you transaction
        * Serializable
            * the highest level of isolation
            * it locks everything, as if no other transactions is running while yours is

* Durability
    * the data is permanent
    * withstands subsequent system failure (power failure, outage, crash, ...)
    * under the hood
        * the database keeps the changes of the transactions in a log file
        * once it saves the logs, the commit is considered successful
        * if the system crashed a millisecond after the log saving, the server can continue its work when it starts again, called recovery
