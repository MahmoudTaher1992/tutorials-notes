Lifting State Up
    There should be a single “source of truth” for any data that changes in a React application.

    Usually, the state is first added to the component that needs it for rendering. Then, if other components 
    also need it, you can lift it up to their closest common ancestor

    Always the data should flow from up to down

    > to share the state you can use the render prop to pass a function containing the state manipulation within it
        > it helps with optimization as you can easily skip it in the dif check in `shouldComponentUpdate`
