Forms
    Controlled Components
        In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their 
        own state and update it based on user input

        React state should be the “single source of truth”

        make input use value from react state, when input value changes handle the event and update react state > 
        rerender > new value will appear on the input

        textarea tag in html > value should be between tag
            <textarea>
                Hello there, this is some text in a text area
            </textarea>

            in React use value instead

        select tag
            use value is select instead of selected attribute in html

            if multiple then the value will be array

        Alternatives to Controlled Components

    Uncontrolled compoenents
        value is not editable
