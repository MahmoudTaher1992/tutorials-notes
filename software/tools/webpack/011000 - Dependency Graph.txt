Dependency Graph
	> Any time one file depends on another, webpack treats this as a dependency
	> Webpack 
		> starts with the file defined in the CLI or in the config file (entry point)
		> recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module your application needs
		> bundles all resources into one/multiple bundles
