Configuration
    > webpack's configuration file is a JavaScript file that exports a webpack configuration
    > This configuration is then processed by webpack

    > Because it's a standard Node.js CommonJS module, you can do the following:
        > Import other files via require(...)
        > use utilities on npm via require(...)
        > use JavaScript control flow expressions, e.g. the ?: operator
        > use constants or variables for often used values
        > write and execute functions to generate a part of the configuration

    > the following practices should be avoided (it is allowed but not recommended)
        > Access CLI arguments, when using the webpack CLI (instead write your own CLI, or use --env)
        > Export non-deterministic values (calling webpack twice should result in the same output files)
        > Write long configurations (instead split the configuration into multiple files)

        > Exporting a Function
            > to get access to env variables
            > to get access to argv variable
        > Exporting a Promise
            > Handy when you need to asynchronously load configuration variables
        > Exporting multiple configurations
            > this is useful for bundling a library for multiple targets such as AMD and CommonJS
            > this outputs into 2 builds
            > You can link between them using "dependencies"
            > Yuo can run them in parallel using "parallelism"
    
    > You can write the config file in
        > TypeScript
        > CoffeeScript
        > Babel and JSX
