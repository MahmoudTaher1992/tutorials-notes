    > How webpack works
        > It creates a dependency graph
            > Dependency graph consists of various modules which your webapp would require to work
                > When an app faces a file that is needed in another file - webpack treats it as a dependency
        > It creates a new package which consists of the minimum number of files required
            > Based on the dependency graph
            > normally 1 file is the output of webpack (called bundle)
