# Conditional Access Policies (CAP)

## Key Concepts
*   **i. The Perimeter:** Applying security rules specifically to this Enterprise App.
*   **ii. MFA Enforcement:** Requiring a 2nd factor (Authenticator App) specifically when accessing this application.
*   **iii. Device Compliance:** Blocking access if the request comes from an unmanaged or non-compliant device.
*   **iv. [NEW] Session Controls:** Limiting session frequency (forcing re-auth every X hours).
