*Goal: Establishing the Trust Relationship.*

## Key Concepts
*   **i. Identifier (Entity ID):** The unique URL provided by the SP (AWS).
*   **ii. Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL):** Where Entra ID sends the authentication token.
*   **iii. [NEW] Metadata Exchange:** Utilizing the Federation Metadata XML file to auto-configure the Service Provider rather than manual entry.
