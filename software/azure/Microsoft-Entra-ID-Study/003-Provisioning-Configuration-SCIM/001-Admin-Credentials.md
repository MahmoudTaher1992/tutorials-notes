Based on the detailed outline provided, you are asking about the specific mechanism used to connect Microsoft Entra ID (the Identity Provider) to an external application (like AWS IAM Identity Center) so that user accounts can be automatically synchronized.

Here is a detailed explanation of Section **3. Provisioning Configuration -> A. Admin Credentials -> i. The Handshake**.

---

### The Concept: SCIM Provisioning
Before understanding the credentials, you must understand what **SCIM** (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) actually does.

*   **SSO (SAML)** handles *authentication* (Log users in).
*   **Provisioning (SCIM)** handles the *lifecycle* (Create, Update, Delete users).

Without SCIM, if you hire a new engineer, you have to create their account in Entra ID (Active Directory) **and then manually create it again** in AWS. With SCIM, Entra ID "pushes" the user to AWS automatically.

### The "Handshake" (Admin Credentials)
This specific section refers to the configuration step where you introduce Entra ID to the external application (Service Provider) and establish a **secure, unilateral channel** for Entra ID to write data into that application.

This is a **client-server relationship** where:
*   **Entra ID is the Client:** It initiates requests (e.g., "Create User Bob").
*   **AWS (or other App) is the Server:** It receives the request and executes it.

For Entra ID to represent itself as a valid admin authorized to create users in the external app, it needs two specific pieces of information:

#### 1. The Tenant URL (SCIM Endpoint)
*   **What it is:** This is the specific web address (API Endpoint) where the external application listens for instructions.
*   **The Analogy:** This is the **mailing address**.
*   **How it works:** When you create a new user in Entra ID, Entra ID will send an HTTP request (like a helper robot) to this specific URL.
*   **Example:** For AWS IAM Identity Center, it usually looks something like this:
    `https://scim.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/12345-abcde-67890/scim/v2/`

#### 2. The Secret Token
*   **What it is:** A long, encrypted string of characters (usually a "Bearer Token") generated by the Service Provider.
*   **The Analogy:** This is the **key to the mailbox**.
*   **How it works:** Simply knowing the URL (Address) isn't enough; otherwise, hackers could flood the endpoint with fake users. To prove that the request is coming from *your* specific Entra ID tenant and that it is authorized, every message sent to the URL includes this Secret Token in the header.
*   **Validity:** These tokens often have an expiration date (e.g., 1 year). If the token expires, the sync stops (the key no longer fits the lock), and you must generate a new one.

### The Workflow: How to configure "The Handshake"

In a real-world scenario (specifically setting this up for AWS as per your TOC), the steps look like this:

1.  **Generate in Service Provider (AWS):**
    *   You log into the AWS IAM Identity Center console.
    *   You go to settings and turn on "Automatic Provisioning."
    *   AWS will generate the **SCIM Endpoint URL** and the **Access Token**. You must copy these immediately (the token is often only shown once).

2.  **Input in Identity Provider (Entra ID):**
    *   You switch to the Microsoft Entra Admin Center.
    *   Navigate to *Enterprise Applications* -> *[Your App]* -> *Provisioning*.
    *   Click on **Admin Credentials**.
    *   You paste the URL into the **Tenant URL** field.
    *   You paste the Token into the **Secret Token** field.

3.  **Test Connection:**
    *   There is a button labeled **"Test Connection"**.
    *   When clicked, Entra ID sends a "dummy" probe request to that URL using that Token.
    *   If the Service Provider replies with `200 OK`, the box turns green. The Handshake is successful. Entra ID now has permission to create and delete users in the remote system.

### Summary
"The Handshake" is the one-time setup where you give Microsoft Entra ID the **destination address** (URL) and the **security clearance** (Token) required to manage user accounts in your external application automatically.
