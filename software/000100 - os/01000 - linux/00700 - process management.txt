    > background and foreground processes
        > in linux the process in
            > foreground is the process that is running and connected to the terminal
            > background is otherwise
                > if the process needs an input, it will stop until it is back in the foreground

        > to send a process to the background
            > ctrl+z to stop the process
            > bg to send it to the background
            > jobs to see the background processes
            > fg to bring it back to the foreground
            > command & to run the command in the background

    > process forking
        > is a processing of creating a duplicate process from an existing one, and running it under the original one
        > the forked child process returns a value that represents it's execution status
