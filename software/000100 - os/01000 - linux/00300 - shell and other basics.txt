Shell and other basics
    > command path
        > the variable contains a list of directories that contain the commands
        > the paths are separated by semi colons
        > when a command is entered, the shell will look in the directories in the path variable for the command
            > linux commands are files stored in directories
            > if you want to execute a command you have to enter the whole directory
            > instead, you can add the directory in the $PATH variable and type only the name of the command
            > the shell will search by the order of the paths in the $PATH variable

    > environment variables
        > dynamic named values
        > exists in every shell session
        > env
            > command to show all the environment variables

    > man <command>
        > stands for manual
        > shows the manual for the command

    > redirects
        > redirection is the mechanism of directing the output of a command to a file or another command
        > in linux each process has
            > standard input (stdin)
                > where the process reads its input
            > standard output (stdout)
                > where the process writes its output
                > goes to the terminal by default
            > standard error (stderr)
                > where the process writes its error messages
                > goes to the terminal by default
        > redirection allows you to change the default behavior of the standard input, output, and error
            > to output the result of a command to a file
                > command > file            
            > to output the stderr of a command to a file
                > command > file 2>errorFile


    > sudo <command>
        > stands for super user do
        > executes the command as the super user
        > also known as root user
        > represents a user with the highest privileges and complete control over the system
            > i.e.
                > ability to modify system configurations
                > change other userâ€™s passwords
                > install and remove software
                > ...
        > super user can cause a series damage

    > su
        > stands for switch user to root
