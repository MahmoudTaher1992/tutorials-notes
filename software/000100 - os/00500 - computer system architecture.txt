Computer system architecture
    > based on the number of general purpose processor
        > there are small micro-processors that may exist in some devices to help them execute specific tasks
            > such as micro-processors in the keyboards to convert key stroke into a key number
        > those are not general purpose processor, instead they are specific processors
        > they are not included in the count of system processors

    > types (based on general purpose processors count)
        > single processor systems
        > Multi-processors systems
        > clustered systems

    > single processor systems
        > contains on CPU in the system

    > Multi-processors systems
        > contains multiple processors in the same system
        > advantages
            > increased throughput
                > throughput is the speed of transferring data
                > more CPUs will transfer the data faster
            > economy of scale
                > it is cheaper to get such systems if you want more processing power instead of buying a complete single processor system (in which you don't need all other parts of the system)
            > increased reliability
                > if one processor fail the others will handle the work 
        > types
            > symmetric multi-processing
                > all the processors are in the same level and they do the work together
            > asymmetric multi-processing
                > one processor is acting as a master and dividing the work among all other processors (salves)
    
    > Clustered systems
        > multiple systems (not CPUs) work together to handle the loads
        > advantages
            > increased reliability 
        > can be structured in symmetric or asymmetric
