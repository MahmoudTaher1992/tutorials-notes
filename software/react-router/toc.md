        *   Query Strings (Search Params) with `useSearchParams` (e.g., `?sort=asc`)
        *   The Full Location Object with `useLocation` (`pathname`, `search`, `hash`, `state`)
    *   **D. Structuring Complex Layouts**
        *   Nested Routes for Hierarchical UI
        *   Layout Routes: Sharing UI across multiple child routes (Sidebars, Headers)

        *   Accessing Loader Data with the `useLoaderData` hook
        *   Passing `params` and `request` objects to loaders
        *   Handling Responses, Redirects, and Deferring Data
    *   **C. Data Mutations & Form Handling**
        *   The `action` Function: Handling data writes (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`)
        *   The `<Form>` Component: Declarative mutations that trigger actions
        *   Accessing Submission Results with `useActionData`
        *   Automatic Data Revalidation after Mutations
    *   **D. Handling In-Flight States & Errors**
        *   Global Navigation State with `useNavigation`
