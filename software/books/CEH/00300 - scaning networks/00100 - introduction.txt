network scanning
    > scanning network gives more information about the target
    > this info will help in determining the attack strategy
    
    > overview
        > it is the process of gathering detailed information about the target, using complex and aggressive reconnaissance techniques
        > network scanning refers to a set of procedures used to identify
            > hosts
            > ports
            > services
            > vulnerabilities
            > other characteristics of a network

            > active machines in a network
            > OS running on the machines

        > important step (information gathering)
            > used afterwards to build an attack strategy
    
    > types of network scanning
        > Port scanning
            > lists the open ports and services
            > done by sending messages trying to break in
            > involves connecting to TCP and UDP ports, to determine whether the services are running or in a listening state
                > the listening state provides info about the OS and the application currently in use
            > sometimes active services that are listening may allow unauthorized access to the system
