SQS - FIFO queue
    > FIFO
        > stands for First In First Out
    > grantees the order of the messages 
    > Limited throughput
        > 300 msg/s without batching
        > 3000 msg/s with batching
    > exactly one message sent (by removing duplicates)
    > messages are processed in order by the consumer

    > Deduplication
        > Deduplication interval is 5 minutes
        > types
            > content based Deduplication
                > compares the hash of the message body and deletes duplicates
            > message deduplication ID
                > messages with the same deduplication ID are considered as duplicates

    > Message grouping
        > all messages with the same group ID will be delivered to the same consumer, in the same order
        > you can have as many groups as you want
        > each group will be delivered to a consumer
        > ordering across groups is not guaranteed
