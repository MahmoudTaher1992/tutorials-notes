Introduction
    > when you have multiple applications, you will need them to communicate with each other
    > there are 2 patterns of communications
        > sync
            > app to app directly
        > async (event based communication)
            > app to queue to app

            > pros
                > decouple the apps from each other
                > scalability is easier for each component

            > there are 3 models of async communication
                > SQS
                    > queue model
                > SNS
                    > pub sub model
                > Kinesis
                    > real time streaming model
