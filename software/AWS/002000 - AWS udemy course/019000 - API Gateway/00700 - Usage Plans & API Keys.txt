Usage Plans & API Keys
    > if you want to make the API available for a paying customers

    > Usage Plans
        > who can access methods on the stage level
        > how much and how fast they can access them
        > use API keys to know the identity of the caller and to measure his usage
        > configure throttling limits and quota limits (overall number of maximum requests) and apply then on clients

    > API Keys
        > alphanumeric string values, distributed to clients
        > i.e.
            > WBjHxNtoAb4WPKBC7cGm64CBibIb24b4jt8jJHo9
        > used with usage plans to control access to the API
        
        > Correct order of API keys
            > usage plan configuration
                > create one or more APIs
                > configure methods to require an API key
                > deploy the APIs
                > generate API keys
                > create usage plans
                > associate API stages and keys with usage plans
