ECS auto scaling
    > automatically increase/decrease the desired number of ECS tasks
    > ECS auto scaling uses AWS application auto scaling
        > scaling based on
            > CPU utilization
            > memory utilization
            > request count per application (from load balancer)
    
    > auto scaling types
        > target tracking scaling
            > scale based on target value for a specific cloudwatch metric
                > metrics are the 3 metrics mentioned above
        > step scaling 
            > scale based on cloud watch alarms
        > scheduled scaling
            > scale based on a schedule

    > ECS scaling is different than EC2 auto scaling
        > ECS scaling is much easier

    > Launch type auto scaling
        > EC2 Launch type
            > ECS will add EC2 instances to the ECS cluster
                > Auto scaling group scaling
                    > scale your ASG based on CPU utilization
                    > add EC2 instances over time
                > ECS cluster capacity provider
                    > used to automatically provision and scale the infrastructure of the ECS task
                    > Capacity provider paired with ASG
                    > add EC2 instances when your are missing capacity

    > auto scaling lifecycle
        > when the value of the metric increases, it fires an alarm
        > the alarm is picked up by the AWS application auto scaling
        > it spins up a new ECS tasks or shuts down one

    > automatic scaling is the ability to automatically increase/decrease the tasks count
    > ECS uses application auto scaling to scale the tasks
        > application auto scaling is a service that lets you automatically scale your services

    > ECS publishes metrics to cloudwatch
        > i.e.
            > CPU utilization
            > memory utilization
            > request count per target

        > you can use those metrics to scale out/in your ECS tasks
            > scale out to meet the demand
            > scale in to save money

    > ECS auto scaling supports the following automatic scaling types
        > target metric value
            > you select a metric and set a target value
            > ECS auto scaling service will create an alarms to fire when the target is exceeded
            > based on the alarm the ECS service will scale out/in

        > predefined increments based on cloudwatch alarms
            > you can setup the scaling yourself, based on cloudwatch alarms
            > it is a manual way to do the target metric value

        > schedule
            > scaling done based on a schedule

        > considerations
            > metrics are sent in 1 minute intervals
            > the services send the metrics to cloudwatch
            > alarms can not be fired without the metrics

            > cool down period is time waited for the activity to take effect
