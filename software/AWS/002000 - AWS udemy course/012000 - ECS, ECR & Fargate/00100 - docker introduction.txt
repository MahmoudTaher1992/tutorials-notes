        > create a docker file (says how the image should look like)
        > create an image from the docker file
        > push image to docker repository
        > you install docker on a machine
        > you create a container from a docker image
        > you run the container

    > where docker images live
        > in a docker repositories
            > i.e.
                > docker hub
                > AWS ECR
                    > Elastic container registry
