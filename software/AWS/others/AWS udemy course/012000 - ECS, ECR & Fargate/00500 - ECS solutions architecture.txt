ECS solutions architecture
    > ECS tasks invoked by event bridge
        > Event bridge can be used to trigger ECS tasks
        > multiple AWS services can be user to trigger events in event bridge
        > so multiple AWS services can be used to trigger ECS tasks

    > ECS tasks invoked by AWS event bridge schedule
        > a scheduled event can be used to trigger ECS tasks

    > SQS queue example 
        > ECS service auto scaling can poll messages from SQS queue

    > you can also connect ECS tasks activities to other services by 
        > triggering an event in event bridge, once a task is created or stopped
        > from the event bridge you can do anything
        
    > by this you can run services that are written in a non cloud service way and integrate it into AWS echo system
