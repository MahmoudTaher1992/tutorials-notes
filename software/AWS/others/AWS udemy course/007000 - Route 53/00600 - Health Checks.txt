Health checks
    > are only for public resources
        > you can setup for private but with a different way
    > Health checks are created and associated with DNS to make Automated DNS failover
    > Possible Health checks
        > Health checks that monitor end points
        > Health checks that monitor another health checks
        > Health checks that monitor cloud watch alarms

    > Have it's own metrics and you can access it from the cloudwatch

    > you setup a health check
        > there are 15 global heath checkers that will run your health check
            > interval is 30 secs
            > supports multiple protocols (i.e. http, https, ...)
            > if 18%+ health checkers report that an end point is healthy, then Route 53 considers it healthy
            > You can configure Route 53 to choose the location of the health checkers

        > it passes if the response is with 2xx or 3xx status codes
        > at the endpoints you have to allow incoming requests from Route 53 Health checkers ip addresses
            > router
            > firewall
            > security group

    > Calculated health checks
        > combine the results of multiple health checks into one (parent) health check
        > you can use OR, AND, NOT
        > you can monitor up to 256 child health checks
        > specify how many health checks need to pass to pass the parent health check
        > usage
            > perform maintenance to your website without cause all health checks to fail

    > private hosted zones
        > route 53 health checkers are outside the vpc
            > they can't access private endpoints (private vpc or on-premises resource)
        > solution
            > create CloudWatch metric + CloudWatch Alarm
            > create a health check that checks on the alarm itself
