Routing Policies
    > Defines how Route 53 will respond to DNS queries
    > Routing here doesn't mean the load balancer's routing, DNS just respond to DNS queries

    > Policies
        > Simple
        > Weighted
        > Failover
        > Latency based
        > Geolocation
        > Multi Value answer
        > Geoproximity (using Route 53 Traffic flow feature)

    > Simple
        > route traffic to a single resource
        > can specify multiple values in the same record
            > all the values will be returned to the client to choose from
        > when Alias is enabled, only one resource is allowed
        > can not be associated with health checks

    > Weighted
        > controls % of requests for each resource
        > weights don't need to sum up to 100%
        > DNS records must have the same name and type
        > can be associated with health checks
        > Use cases
            > load balancing
            > testing new apps on a small traffic 
        > if all weights are 0 then traffic will be directed evenly
        > if one is 0 then it will receive no traffic

    > Latency
        > redirect to the resource which has the least Latency
        > Route 53 will calculate the distance between the request location and the resource location and will decide base on it
        > Helpful when the latency is a priority
        > can be associated with health checks
