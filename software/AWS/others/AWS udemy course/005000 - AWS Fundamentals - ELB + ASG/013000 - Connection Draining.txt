Connection Draining
    > It has two names
        > CLB - Connection Draining
        > ALB & NLB - De-registration Delay
    > It is the time given to the "in-flight requests" to complete while the instance is de-registering/becoming unhealthy
    > The ELB stops sending requests to the draining instance
    > it is between 1-3600 secs (300 secs is the default)
