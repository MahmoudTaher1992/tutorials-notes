Auto Scaling Group
    > In real life , the load on your websites and app can change
    > In the cloud you can create and get rid of servers very quickly
    > The goal of ASG
        > Scale out (add new EC2 instances) to match an increase load
        > Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
        > Ensure we have a min and max number of EC2 instances are running
        > Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
        > Recreate an EC2 instance in case a prev one is terminated (if unhealthy)
    > Totally free (you pay for what the ASG creates - EC2s)

    > Min capacity
        > Min EC2 instances count
    > Desired capacity
        > Desired EC2 instances count
    > Max capacity
        > Max EC2 instances count

    > Launch template
        > A template that defined what the new EC2 shape is
            > AMI + instance type
            > EC2 user data
            > EBS volumes
            > Security groups
            > SSH Key Pair
            > IAM roles for EC2 instances
            > Network + Subnets information
            > Load Balancer information

    > It is possible to scale as ASG based on CloudWatch alarms
    > An alarm monitors a metric (i.e Average CPU, ... etc)
        > When it triggers > it tells the ASG to scale out
        > Same can be done in scale in
