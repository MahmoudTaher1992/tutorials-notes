SSL Certificates
    > SSL/TLS Basics
        > An SSL certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit
        > SSL refers to Secure Socket Layer, used to encrypt connections
        > TSL refers to TRansport Layer Security and it is the newer version of SSL
            > It is mainly used but people still call it SSL
        > Public SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authority
            > Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign, Digicert, Letsencrypt, etc ...
        > SSL certificates have an expiration date (you set) and then it must be renewed

    > SSL certificates
        > The load balancer uses and X.509 certificate (SSL/TLS server certificate)
        > You can manager certificates using ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)
        > You can create and upload your own certificates alternatively
        > HTTPS listeners
            > You must specify a default certificate
            > You can add an optional list of certs to support multiple domains
            > Clients use SNI (Server Name Indication) to specify the hostname they reach
            > Ability to specify a security policy to support older versions of SSL/TLS (legacy clients)

    > SNI (Server Name Indication)
        > SNI solves the problem of loading multiple SSL certificates onto one web server (to serve multiple websites)
        > It is a newer protocol and requires the client to indicate the hostname of the target server in the initial SSL handshake
        > The server will then find the correct certificate or return the default one
        > Only works with 
            > ALB
            > NLB
            > CloudFront
        > Doesn't work with CLB

    > SSL & ELB
        > CLB v1 (Classic Load Balancer)
            > Supports only one SSL certificate
            > Must use multiple CLB for multiple hostname with multiple SSL certificates
        > ALB v2 (Application Load Balancer)
            > Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
            > Uses SNI to make it work
        > NLB v2 (Network Load Balancer)
            > Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
            > Uses SNI to make it work
