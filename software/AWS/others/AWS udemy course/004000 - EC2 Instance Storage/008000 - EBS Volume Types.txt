EBS Volume Types
    > Terminologies
        > Disk throughput
            > The measurement of how fast (per second) your storage can read/write data
            > You may see the effect when moving on from HDD to SSD
            > This is typically written in MB/s or megabytes per second (size of operations)
        > IOPS
            > = input/output operations per second
            > lesser-known measurement of HDD or SSD performance
            > measures the amount of read/write operations (# of operations) your storage can do in a second


    > Comes in 6 types
        > gp2/gp3 (SSD)
            > General purpose SSD volume
            > Balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads
            > 1 GiB - 16 TiB
            > gp3
                > IOPS (from 3000 IOPS to 16000 IOPS)
                > Throughput (from 125 MiB/s to 1000 MiB/s) 
                > can be set independently
                    > IOPS=3000, Throughput=1000 MiB/s
            > gp2
                > IOPS (from 3000 IOPS to 16000 IOPS)
                > IOPS and size of the volume are linked
                    > 3 IOPS/GB
                    > @ 5334 GB you get max IOPS

        > io1/io2 (SSD) - Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS)
            > High performance SSD volume
            > Good for workloads with
                > mission-critical - sustained IOPS
                > low-latency
                > high-throughput
                > apps that need more that 16000 IOPS
            > Great for db workload
            > io1/io2 (4 GiB - 16 TiB)
                > 64000 Max PIOPS for Nitro EC2 instances (32000 for others)
                > Can increase PIOPS independently from volume
                > io2 have more durability and more IOPS/GiB (same price as io1)
            > io2 Block Express (4 GiB - 64 TiB)
                > Sub-millisecond latency
                > Max PIOPS 250000 with 1000:1 ratio IOPS/GiB
            > Supports EBS multi attach

        > st1/sc1 (HDD)
            > Hard Disk Drives
            > Can't be a boot volume
            > (125 MiB - 16 TiB)
            > st1 (HDD)
                > Low cost HDD volume
                > Designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads
                    > Big Data
                    > Data Warehouses
                    > Log processing
                > Max throughput (500 MiB/s), Max IOPS (500)  
            > sc1 (HDD)
                > Lowest cost HDD volume
                > Designed for less frequently accessed workloads
                > Max throughput (250 MiB/s), Max IOPS (250)  
                

    > EBS volumes characteristics
        > Size
        > Throughput (MB/s)
        > IOPS (#/s)
    > (gp2/gp3), (io1/io2) can be used as boot volumes
