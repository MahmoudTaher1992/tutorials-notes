Stages
    > A deployment must be made after API gateway changes
    > it is a common source of confusion
    > changes are deployed to a selected stage
    > deployments can be rolled back on a stage
    > you can name the stage as you want

    > Stage variables
        > like environment variables for API Gateway
        > it is passed to the context object of the lambda function
        > format is ${stageVariables.variableName}
        > uses
            > change configuration between stages
            > enable canary deployment for any stage (ability to choose the % of traffic that goes to a canary stage)
            > separate metrics and logs
