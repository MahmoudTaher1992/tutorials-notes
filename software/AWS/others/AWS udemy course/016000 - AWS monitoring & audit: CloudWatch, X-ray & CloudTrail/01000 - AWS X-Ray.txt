    > Tracing
        > is an end to end way to following a request as it goes through your microservices
        > each component dealing with the request adds its own "trace segment"
        > Tracing is made of segments and subsegments
        > Extra information can be added to a segment via annotations and metadata
        > gives the ability to trace each request

        > IAM for authorization

    > Enabling AWS X-ray
        > import AWS X-Ray SDK in your code
        > install AWS X-Ray daemon or enable X-Ray AWS integration
            > the SDK will send the traces to the daemon and in turn it will send it to X-Ray
        > IAM rights will be needed accordingly
