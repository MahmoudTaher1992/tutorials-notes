AWS CloudTrail
    > provides audit history of your AWS account
    > enabled by default
    > provides a history of events/API calls made within your AWS account by:
        - Console
        - SDK
        - CLI
        - AWS Services

    > Logs can be stored in S3 and CloudWatch Logs
    > if a resource is deleted, you can see the history of API calls made on that resource

    > events
        > management events
            > operations that are performed on resources in your account
            > e.g. describeInstances, runInstances, createLoadBalancer
            > By default, trails are configured to log management events
            > Can separate read events from write events

        > data events
            > By default data events are not logged, because they can be very high volume
        
        > CloudTrail Insights events
            > Detects unusual activity in your account
            > CloudTrail analysis the normal events and come up with a baseline, then it can detect if there is an anomaly
            
    > retention
        > Logs are stored for 90 days
        > if more retention is needed, logs can be sent to S3 and analiesed by Athena

    > CloudTrail vs CloudWatch vs X-Ray
        > CloudTrail
            > provides API call history
            > can be used to detect unusual activity
            > can be used to track changes to resources
        > CloudWatch
            > performance monitoring
            > log aggregation
            > can create alarms
        > X-Ray
            > helps debug applications
            > provides request tracing
            > provides a service map
