    > many new apps execute some of the code at the edge
        > Edge function
            > a code that you write and attach to CloudFront distributions
            > runs close to user to minimize latency

    > CloudFront provides two kinds of Functions

        > used to change
            > viewer request
            > viewer response
        > Native feature of CloudFront

    > Lambda@Edge
        > lambda functions written in NodeJs/Python
        > scales up to 1000s requests/second
        > used to change
            > viewer request
            > viewer response
            > origin request
