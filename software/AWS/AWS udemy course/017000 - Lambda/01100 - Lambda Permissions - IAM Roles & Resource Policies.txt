Lambda Permissions - IAM Roles & Resource Policies
    > Lambda execution role (IAM role)
        > grants lambda function permissions to AWS resources/services
        > Sample managed Policies
            > ready made policies to be used directly
            
        > when you use event source mapping, lambda use those polices to read data
        > best practice
            > create one lambda execution role per function

    > Lambda resource based policies
        > gives permissions to other services to use the lambda resources
        > similar to S3 bucket policies for S3 bucket
        > an IAM principle can access lambda if
            > an IAM policy is attached to the IAM principle authorizes it
            > if resource based policies authorizes it
