High Availability and Scalability
    > Scalability
        > An app/system can handle greater loads by adapting.
        > Types
            > Vertical Scalability (scale up/down)
                > You need to increase the size of the instance
                > Common way of scaling on RDS, ElastiCache
                > there is a limit

            > Horizontal Scalability (scale out/in)
                > increase the number of instances/systems for the app
                > Works with distributed systems
                > Very common for web apps
                > Easy to do these days using AWS EC2
                > Usage of load balancers to manage multiple instances
        
    > High availability
        > Linked but different than scalability
        > The goal is to survive a data center loss
        > Running you app in at least 2 data centers when one goes down the other works
