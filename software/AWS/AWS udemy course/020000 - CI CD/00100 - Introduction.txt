Introduction
    > CI CD is the process of transforming the code from the codebase to the production environment
    > it is all about automation

    > CI/CD Services
        > AWS CodeCommit
            > storing the code
        > AWS CodePipeline
            > automating the pipeline from code to Elastic Beanstalk
        > AWS CodeBuild
            > building and testing the code
        > AWS CodeDeploy
            > deploying the code to EC2 instances
        > AWS CodeStar
            > manage software activities in one place
        > AWS CodeArtifact
            > store and share software packages
        > AWS CodeGuru
            > automate code reviews using ML

    > Continuous Integration (CI)
        > continuous building and testing of the code
        > steps
            > the developer commits the code to the code repository
            > the build server pulls the code, test it and build it
            > a feedback is given to the developer

        > helps in
            > fixing the bug early
            > deliver faster as the code is always ready to deploy
            > deploy often
    
    > Continuous Deployment (CD)
        > ensures the software can be released reliably whenever needed
        > ensures the deployment happens often and are quick
        > shift away from one release every 6 months to multiple releases in a day
        > it means automated deployment
