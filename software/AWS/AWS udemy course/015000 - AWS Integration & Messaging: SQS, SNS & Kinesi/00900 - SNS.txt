SNS
    > stands for Simple Notification Service.
    > it uses pub-sub pattern
    > it lets you send the same message to infinite number of subscribers.
    > it is like ASG in notifications

    > the event producer will only send one notification to SNS topic
    > SNS will send it to all subscribers
    > you can setup a filter on each subscriber, to deliver them what you want

    > 12.5M subscribers per topic
    > 100k topics limit

    > subscribers list
        > SQS
        > Lambda
        > kinesis Data Firehose
        > Email
        > SMS
        > mobile notifications
        > HTTP endpoints

    > event sources
        > lots of AWS services

    > How to publish
        > Topic subscription (using the SDK)
            > create a topic
            > add a subscriber to a topic
            > publish to a topic

        > Direct publish (for mobile apps SDK)
            > integrate with mobile platforms to send push notifications
                > i.e.
                    > Google GCM
                    > Apple APNS
                    > Amazon ADM

    > Security
        > Encryption
            > inflight
            > at rest
            > client side

        > Access Control
            > IAM policies

        > SNS access policies
            > useful for cross account access
            > useful for allowing other services to use SQS

    > SNS + SQS fan out
        > push once to SNS, all SQS will get the message
        > fully decoupled
        > no data loss
        > data persistence
        > delayed processing
        > retry mechanism
        > ability to add subscribers
        
        > applications
            > S3 events to multiple queues
                > S3 can have one event rule for a same combination
                > you can overcome this issue by using SNS as one target and it will pass all messages to the subscribers

            > SNS to S3
                > SNS can not send to S3 directly
                > you can use kinesis in between

    > FIFO
        > implements ordering and deduplication
        > can only have SQS FIFO queues as subscribers
        > Limited throughput

    > Message filtering
        > json policy used to filter messages going to subscribers
        > it can be applied to each subscriber
        > if no filter is applied, the subscriber will get all messages
