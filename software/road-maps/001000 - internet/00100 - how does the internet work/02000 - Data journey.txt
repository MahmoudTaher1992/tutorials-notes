Data Journey
    > Data can be converted into many forms
        > electrical pulses
        > electro-magnetic waves in cellular towers
        > light in optical fibers
    > i.e.
        > traffic light transfer 3 data to human beings
            > Green => Go
            > Yellow => Prepare for stop
            > Red => stop
    > There are lots of devices that convert the data from one form to another
    > A message journey from a keyboard to the Whatsapp of another phone
        > thermal energy from fingers to the screen => electrical energy
        > electrical pulses to the processor => another electrical pulses (request)
        > request (electrical pulses) to antenna => electro-magnetic wave => cellular towers
        > Cellular tower converts electro-magnetic waves to electrical pulses
        > electrical pulses are converted into light and sent through high-tech optical fibers
        > optical fibers (light) => electrical pulses => electro-magnetic waves => recipient's mobile
        > electrical pulses => processor => message in whatsapp
