Of course. Here is a similarly detailed Table of Contents for studying Web Components, with a specific focus on HTML Templates as a core part of the technology.

```markdown
*   **Part I: Fundamentals of the Component-Based Web**
    *   **A. The "Why" of Web Components: The Motivation**
        *   The Pre-Component Era: "Div Soup" and jQuery Plugins

        *   Component Model as a Solution: A Brief Comparison with Framework Components (React, Vue, Angular)
        *   The Goal: Browser-Native, Encapsulated, and Reusable UI Primitives
    *   **B. The Core Technologies: The "What"**
        *   Introduction to the Three Pillars of Web Components
        *   **Custom Elements:** Defining your own HTML tags
        *   **Shadow DOM:** Encapsulating markup and styles
        *   **HTML Templates:** Defining inert chunks of markup for later use
        *   The Unsung Hero: ES Modules for Definition and Distribution
    *   **C. The Anatomy of a Simple Web Component**

        *   Exposing Public Methods for Imperative Control
        *   Emitting Custom Events to Communicate Outwards (`new CustomEvent()`)
    *   **B. Content Projection with Slots**
        *   The Concept of "Light DOM" vs. "Shadow DOM"
        *   Using the `<slot>` Element for Content Distribution
        *   Default Slots and Fallback Content
        *   Named Slots for Structured Content Injection
    *   **C. Styling API and Theming**
        *   The Encapsulation Boundary: How CSS is Scoped by Shadow DOM

        *   The `::part()` and `::slotted()` CSS Pseudo-Elements for Exposing Style Hooks
        *   Inheritable vs. Non-Inheritable Styles Across the Shadow Boundary
    *   **D. Designing for Accessibility (A11y)**
        *   Using ARIA Roles, States, and Properties within the Component
        *   Managing Focus within the Shadow DOM
        *   Associating Labels with Form-Associated Components

*   **Part III: Core Technology Deep Dive**
    *   **A. Custom Elements**
        *   **Lifecycle Callbacks**
            *   `constructor()`: Element is created
            *   `connectedCallback()`: Element is inserted into the DOM
            *   `disconnectedCallback()`: Element is removed from the DOM
            *   `adoptedCallback()`: Element is moved to a new document
        *   Autonomous Custom Elements (e.g., `<my-element>`)
        *   Customized Built-in Elements (e.g., `<button is="my-button">`) and their Status
    *   **B. Shadow DOM**
        *   Creating a Shadow Root: `attachShadow({ mode: 'open' | 'closed' })`
        *   Understanding the Shadow Boundary
        *   Event Retargeting and Bubbling Across the Boundary
        *   Styling the Host Element from Within: The `:host` Pseudo-class
        *   Conditional Host Styling: `:host()` and `:host-context()`
    *   **C. HTML Templates & Cloning**
        *   **The `<template>` Element**
            *   Properties: Inert by Default (Not Rendered, No Scripts Run)
            *   Accessing the Content via the `.content` Property (`DocumentFragment`)
        *   **Cloning and Instantiation**
            *   `template.content.cloneNode(true)`: The Standard Pattern
            *   Populating and Attaching the Cloned Content to the Shadow Root
        *   **Combining Templates and Slots**
            *   Defining a Component's Structure in a `<template>`
            *   Placing `<slot>` elements inside the template as content placeholders
            *   A Complete Workflow: Define in `<template>`, Clone, Attach to Shadow DOM

*   **Part IV: Advanced Concepts & Patterns**
