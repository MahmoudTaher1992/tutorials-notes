CloudFormation
    Setting up AWS services is hard and tedious

    If you want to automate the process and just write it in a piece of document, give it someone and he will do the rest
    That is exactly what CloudFormation does!

    It allows you to defind a file > CloudFormation will do the rest.

    It is easy to use.

    Template files should be writting in a .yaml || .json file > .yaml is more popular.
