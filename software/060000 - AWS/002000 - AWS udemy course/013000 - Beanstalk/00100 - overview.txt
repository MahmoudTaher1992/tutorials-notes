Overview
    > Elastic Beanstalk is a higher-level service that simplifies application deployment and management
        > while CloudFormation is a lower-level service that provides more control over resource configuration.

    > beanstalk uses cloudformation under the hood to deploy the stack

        > configuring all components
        > scaling concerns
        > all the devs want to just run the code

    > most web apps have the same architecture (ALB + ASG)
    
    > Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application
    > it uses all the components

        > the developer still have full control over the configuration
        > is free, but you pay for underlying services

                > web server environment tier
                    > uses ELB to scale the groups
                > worker environment tier
                    > uses SQS queue to scale the groups
            > you can create multiple environments

    > steps
        > create an application
        > upload version
        > launch environment
        > manage environment

    > deployment modes
        > single instance
            > great for developer
            > EC2 instance + RDS
        > high availability with load balancer
            > great for production
            > ELB + multiple (EC2 instance + RDS)
