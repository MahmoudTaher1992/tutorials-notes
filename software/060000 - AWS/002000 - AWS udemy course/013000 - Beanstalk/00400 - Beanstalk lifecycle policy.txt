Beanstalk lifecycle policy
    > Beanstalk can store up to 1000 app versions
    > if you don't remove the old versions, you won't be able to deploy anymore
    > to phase out old applications, use a lifecycle policy
        > based on time (old versions are removed)
        > based on space (when you have too many versions)
    > versions that are currently used won't be deleted
    > there is an option to prevent the deletion of the source bundle in S3 to prevent data loss
