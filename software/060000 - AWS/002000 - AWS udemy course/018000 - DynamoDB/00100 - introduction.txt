Introduction
    > NoSQL databases
        > non relational databases
        > i.e
            > MongoDB
            > DynamoDb
            > ...
        > don't support query joins
        > no aggregations (group by, sum, avg, ...)
        > scale horizontly

    > AWS DynamoDB
        > Fully managed, highly available with replication in multiple AZs
        > NoSQL database
        > Scales to massive workloads
        > Autoscalling is possible
        > Fast and consistent in performance
        > Integrated with IAM for security
        > Enables event driven programming with DynamoDB streams
        > Low costs
        > Tables classes
            > Standard
            > Standard-Infrequent access
                > lower cost

    > DynamoDB Basics
        > DynamoDB is madeup of tables
        > Each table must have a primary key (must be decided at the creation time)
        > Each table can have an infinite number of items (rows)
        > each item has attributes (columns)
        > max item size is 400KB
    
    > Primary keys
        > types
            > Partition key (hash key)
                > unique for each item
                > must be diverse
                > user id can be a good partition key for a user table
            > Partition key + Sort key
                > combination must be unique
                > data is grouped by partition key
                > sort key is used to sort items with the same partition key
