AWS CLI Credentials Provider Chain
    > CLI will look for the credentials in order
        1. Command line options
        2. Environment variables
        3. CLI credentials file
        4. CLI configuration file
        5. Container credentials
        6. Instance profile credentials

        > each SDK will have different order, check each for info

    > Credentials best practices
        > NEVER EVER STORE CREDENTIALS IN THE CODE
        > use IAM roles if you want your instances to use the cli/aws other services
        > use environmental variables if you are outside AWS
