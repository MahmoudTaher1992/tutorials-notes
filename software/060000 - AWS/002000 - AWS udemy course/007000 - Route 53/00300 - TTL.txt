    > High TTL
        > i.e. 24hrs
        > pros 
            > low cost
        > cons
            > outdated records

    > Low TTL
        > i.e. 30 secs
        > pros
            > 30 secs only to get the new record
        > cons
            > high cost

    > TTL is a must for non alias records

    > a good technique
        > make High TTL in normal periods
        > when you want to change the values of the records
            > first decrease the TTL to 60 secs
            > wait for 24 hrs or the high TTL you use
            > change the values
            > put the TTL to the high value again
