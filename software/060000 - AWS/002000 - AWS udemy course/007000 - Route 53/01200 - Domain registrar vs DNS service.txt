        > i.e.
            > GoDaddy
            > Amazon Registrar
            > ...
    > DNS Service
        > manage your DNS records
        > you can use another DNS service provider other than the provider that you bought the registrar from
        > i.e.
            > you buy the domain name from GoDaddy and use AWS Route 53 to manage the DNS records
            > you will have to config GoDaddy to pass the DNS requests to Route 53
                > update the GoDaddy records to use Route 53 name servers
