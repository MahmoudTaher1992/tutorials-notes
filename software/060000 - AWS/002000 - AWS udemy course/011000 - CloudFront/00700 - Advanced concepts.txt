Advanced concepts
    > Price classes
        > you can reduce the costs by reducing the number of edge locations
    
    > multiple origins
        > use cache behavior to do so
        > i.e.
            > /api/*
                > goes to EC2 instance
            > /*
                > goes to S3 bucket

    > origin groups
        > to increase availability and to do a failover
        > consists of two origins, one is primary and the second is secondary
        > if the primary fails, the secondary is used

    > Field level encryption
        > protects user sensitive information
        > additional layer over HTTPs
        > sensitive information is encrypted (asymmetric) at the edge location by the public key
        > the origin is responsible for decrypting the field by the private key
