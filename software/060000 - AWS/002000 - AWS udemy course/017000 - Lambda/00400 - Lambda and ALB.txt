Lambda and ALB
    > If you want to expose the lambda as an HTTP/s endpoint you can use
        > ALB
        > API gateway
    > you will need to register the lambda function in a target group

    > Lambda doesn't understand the HTTP requests, it just understands a lambda invocation
        > ALB and API gateway will change the HTTP request to JSON object which will be used in the lambda invocation
        > the result will be converted from JSON into HTTP response

    > ALB can support multi-header value
        > HTTP headers and query strings that are sent with multiple values will be converted into arrays
