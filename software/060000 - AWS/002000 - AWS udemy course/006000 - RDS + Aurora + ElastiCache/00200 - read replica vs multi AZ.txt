Read replica vs multi AZ
    > Read replica
        > if you want to scale the readability of the database, this is an option
        > you can create up to 15 replica
        > replicas can be promoted to their own database
        > applications must update the connection string setup to connect to the replicas
        > you can not use CRUD SQL statements on replicas
        > replication is done ASYNC

        > there is an aws cost associated with moving the data across different AZs
            > but not with this service, as long as AZs are in the same region
            > you will pay if you move the data across regions (replicas are in different regions than the original database)

    > Multi AZ
        > replication is done SYNC
        > there will be on DNS
        > increased availability
        > an automatic failover will happen and database is switched directly
        > no manual setup is done in the application level
        > Read replica can be setup as RDS multi AZs
        > you can change RDS from single AZ to multi AZ
            > no down time
            > it means that a standby database will be created and linked with the master one
