    > Default TTL is 300 seconds
    > caches are defined per stage
    > cache configuration is done per method
    > cache can be encrypted
    > can be between .5GB and 237GB
    > use it carefully, it is be expensive

    > invalidation
        > ability to invalidate the cache entirely or just a part of it
        > clients can invalidate the cache by passing a cache-control header
        > Any client can invalidate the cache
            > can be invalidated by enforcing an InvalidateCache policy
