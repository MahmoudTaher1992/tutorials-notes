Cross-Zone Load Balancing
    > A feature that allows the load to be distributed evenly across all instances in all AZs
        > it happens when you have two ELB each of which have multiple instances under them
        > when activated the ELBs will communicate together to redistribute the traffic evenly on all instances
    > Without it you won't achieve even distribution across AZs, However you will get even
      distribution across instances in the same AZ
