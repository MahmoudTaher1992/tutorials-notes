### **Transcript: Level Up Your Personal Brand Workshop**

You guys—  

**00:00:06**  
Welcome, everyone! My name is MC, and I’m your Senior Community Experience Manager here at Andela. You’ve probably seen me in the ALC or the Andela Community. Today, I’m excited to host this event in partnership with Melanie and our marketing team. It’s going to be an amazing workshop!  

**00:00:35**  
A few housekeeping notes: With 82 people in the room, please keep yourself muted during the presentation. We’ll have Q&A at the end—drop questions in the Q&A tab (not chat) so they don’t get lost. You can upvote questions you resonate with, and we’ll prioritize those.  

**00:01:11**  
Look for the Q&A button near the chat. Now, I’ll hand it over to **Melanie Feldham**—she has 15+ years of experience, and I’ll let her introduce her title. Over to you, Mel!

#### **Melanie Feltham**  
**00:01:40**  
Thanks, MC! I’m thrilled to be here. I’m Melanie Feltham, **Senior Brand Communications Manager** at Andela. For 15+ years, I’ve helped people and organizations stand out online by building valuable networks. Today’s workshop is **“Level Up Your Personal Brand.”**  

**00:02:11**  
You’ll get a **worksheet** later to apply what we discuss. Let’s start with an activity: **LinkedIn Bingo**. Check how many of these statements apply to you (e.g., “My photo is older than 5 years”—guilty!). Drop your score in chat.  

**00:03:38**  
### **Agenda**  
1. **Why build a personal brand?**  
2. **Optimizing your LinkedIn profile.**  
3. **Visual identity tips.**  
4. **Building a valuable network.**  
5. **Measuring success.**  

**00:04:13**  
Personal branding isn’t about logos—it’s **how you show up online**. Answer: *What do you want to be known for professionally?* Think of someone in your field who’s always top of mind—that’s their brand at work.  

**00:05:48**  
### **Why It Matters**  
- **90% of hiring managers check LinkedIn profiles.**  
- **70–85% of jobs are never posted** (hidden job market).  
- Your brand = career growth + future-proofing.  

**00:07:22**  
### **LinkedIn Focus**  
LinkedIn is the top channel for career growth. It’s a **living resume**, portfolio, and network combined.  

**00:08:13**  
### **Profile Optimization**  
- **Headline**: Most valuable real estate. Use: *Role + Top Skills + Tools*.  
- **About Section**: 3–5 short paragraphs. Be conversational—focus on passions and goals.  
- **Experience**: Link projects, highlight outcomes (not just responsibilities).  
- **Skills**: Be strategic. Include variants (e.g., “Infrastructure as Code” *and* “Terraform”).  
- **Featured Section**: Showcase posts, projects, or repositories.  
- **Recommendations**: Ask colleagues—write one for them first!  

**00:13:07**  
### **Visual Identity**  
- **Photo**: Smile (with teeth!), recent, clear (use portrait mode). Canva can edit backgrounds.  
- **Banner**: Get creative (see Aaron’s example with coded skills). Avoid text overload.  

**00:17:32**  
### **Networking**  
- **70–85% of jobs come from networking**.  
- **Post, participate, connect** (10–15 min/day).  
- **Content pillars**: Projects, industry trends, tech stack opinions, milestones.  

**00:20:26**  
### **Posting Tips**  
- **2–3 posts/week** ideal.  
- **Hashtags**: Not dead! Use like a filing system (e.g., #DevLife).  
- **Timing**: Post when convenient—algorithms prioritize relevance.  

**00:24:45**  
No graphic design skills? Use **Canva** for free templates or post text-only.  

**00:27:06**  
### **Engagement Best Practices**  
- **Comment thoughtfully** (e.g., “Why I voted for X in this poll”).  
- **Avoid spammy tagging** or engagement pods.  
- **Don’t feed trolls**.  

**00:29:44**  
### **Follow Strategically**  
- Interact with accounts that align with your goals (e.g., Andela’s LinkedIn showcases technologists!).  

**00:32:09**  
### **Measuring Success**  
- Enable **Creator Mode** for analytics.  
- **1% engagement rate is normal**; focus on trends.  
- **Buffer** (free tool) schedules posts.  

**00:37:58**  
### **Exercise**  
Post on LinkedIn tagging **@Andela** (sample prompts in chat). We’ll engage with you!
