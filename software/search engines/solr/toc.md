        *   Understanding Commits: `hardCommit` (durability to disk) vs. `softCommit` (searchability)
        *   Real-Time Get: Retrieving a document before it has been committed
    *   **C. The Standard Query Syntax**
        *   **Common Query Parameters:**
            *   `q`: The user's query
            *   `fq`: Filter Query (for faceting and filtering without affecting scores)
            *   `fl`: Field List (specifying which fields to return)
            *   `sort`: Ordering the results
            *   `start` & `rows`: Paginating through results
        *   Boolean Operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) and Field-Specific Searches (`title:"Apache Solr"`)
    *   **D. Query Parsers: Changing How Solr Understands Queries**
        *   Standard (Lucene) Parser: The default, powerful but strict
        *   **DisMax & eDisMax (Extended DisMax):** User-friendly parsers designed for searching across multiple fields, with better default settings and tolerance for syntax errors

*   **Part IV: Text Analysis & Advanced Search Features**
    *   **A. The Analysis Process (via Field Types)**
        *   Anatomy of an Analyzer: `CharFilter`, `Tokenizer`, `TokenFilter`
        *   How text is processed from input string to indexed terms
    *   **B. Common Analysis Techniques**
        *   **Stemming:** Reducing words to their root (e.g., "running" -> "run")
        *   **Synonyms:** Expanding searches to include related terms (e.g., "laptop" also matches "notebook")
        *   **Stop Words:** Ignoring common, low-value words (e.g., "a", "the", "is")
    *   **C. Faceting: Slicing and Dicing Search Results**
        *   **Field Faceting:** Getting counts for all terms in a field (e.g., categories, brands)
        *   **Query Faceting:** Getting counts for arbitrary queries
        *   **Range Faceting:** Getting counts for numeric or date ranges (e.g., price ranges)
