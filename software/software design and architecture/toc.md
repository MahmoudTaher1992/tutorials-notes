                2.  **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity, exposing essential features.
                3.  **Inheritance**: "is-a" relationships, code reuse.
                4.  **Polymorphism**: "many forms," dynamic binding.

        *   **Command Query Separation (CQS)**: Separating methods that change state from those that don't.
