        *   **Zero-Installs**
            *   Concept: Committing the `.yarn/cache` to Git
            *   Benefits for CI/CD and Team Collaboration
        *   **The `.yarn/` Directory Structure**
            *   `/cache`: Zipped package archives
            *   `/releases`: The Yarn binary itself
            *   `/plugins`, `/sdks`
    *   **C. Editor and Tooling Integration (PnP)**
        *   The Need for SDKs (e.g., for VSCode, TypeScript)
        *   Running `yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode`
        *   Troubleshooting common PnP-related tool issues
    *   **D. Migration from Yarn Classic or npm**
        *   Setting the Yarn version (`yarn set version berry`)
        *   The migration process and potential pitfalls
        *   Choosing a `nodeLinker`: `pnp`, `pnpm`, or `node-modules`
