### A Study Guide for Package Managers (npm, Yarn, pnpm, etc.)

*   **Part I: Fundamentals of Dependency Management**
    *   **A. Introduction to Software Dependencies**
        *   The Problem: "Dependency Hell" and the "Works on My Machine" Syndrome
        *   What is a Package Manager? Core Responsibilities
        *   The Core Components of a Package Ecosystem
            *   **Package:** A reusable unit of code.
            *   **Registry:** A central server for hosting and distributing packages (e.g., npmjs.com, Maven Central).
            *   **Manifest:** A project metadata file (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`).
            *   **Lock File:** A snapshot of exact dependency versions.
    *   **B. Core Concepts & Terminology**
        *   Direct vs. Transitive (or Indirect) Dependencies
        *   The Dependency Graph/Tree
        *   The Diamond Dependency Problem
        *   Deterministic vs. Non-Deterministic Installs
    *   **C. Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**
        *   The `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` structure
        *   Version Constraint Syntax: Tilde (`~`), Caret (`^`), Ranges (`>=`, `<`), and Exact versions
        *   Pre-release and Build Metadata
    *   **D. Comparison of Major Package Manager Philosophies**
        *   **npm:** The original, bundled with Node.js
        *   **Yarn (v1 "Classic" vs. v2+ "Berry"):** Focus on performance, determinism, and novel features (PnP).
        *   **pnpm:** Focus on disk space efficiency and strictness via symlinks.
        *   Comparison with managers from other ecosystems (e.g., `pip`/`poetry` for Python, `Maven`/`Gradle` for Java, `Cargo` for Rust, `Composer` for PHP).

*   **Part II: The Anatomy of a Package & Project**
    *   **A. The Package Manifest (`package.json` as the primary example)**
        *   Essential Metadata: `name`, `version`, `description`, `main`, `license`
        *   Dependency Declarations: `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `peerDependencies`, `optionalDependencies`
        *   Scripts and Tooling Configuration: `scripts`, `bin`, `files`
    *   **B. The Lock File (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`)**
        *   Purpose: The key to reproducible builds.
        *   What it contains: Exact resolved versions, integrity hashes (subresource integrity), and the full dependency tree.
        *   How and when it's generated and updated.
    *   **C. The Local Installation (`node_modules` folder)**
        *   The traditional nested `node_modules` structure.
        *   Dependency Hoisting: How npm and Yarn Classic flatten the tree to reduce duplication.
        *   pnpm's symlinked, content-addressable store approach.
    *   **D. The Package Itself: Structure and Distribution**
        *   Package contents: Source files, compiled assets, type definitions.
        *   Excluding files with `.npmignore` or the `files` property.
        *   The packaged format (e.g., `.tgz` tarball).

*   **Part III: Core Operations & The Resolution Algorithm**
    *   **A. Core CLI Commands and Their Effects**
        *   `install` / `add`: Resolving dependencies, updating lock file and `node_modules`.
        *   `update` / `upgrade`: Applying updates according to SemVer constraints.
        *   `remove` / `uninstall`: Pruning the dependency tree.
        *   `run`: Executing scripts defined in the manifest.
        *   `audit`: Checking for known security vulnerabilities.
        *   `ci`: Clean install based strictly on the lock file.
    *   **B. The Dependency Resolution Process (Under the Hood)**
        *   Building the initial dependency tree from the manifest.
        *   Version selection and constraint solving (Satisfiability - SAT).
        *   Peer dependency resolution and conflicts.
        *   Generating/updating the lock file.
        *   Fetching and populating the `node_modules` directory.
    *   **C. Interacting with the Registry**
        *   Authentication: Logging in, tokens, and `.npmrc` configuration.
        *   Scopes and Namespaces (`@org/package`).
        *   Dist-tags (`latest`, `next`, `beta`).

*   **Part IV: Security in the Software Supply Chain**
    *   **A. Core Threat Models**
        *   Malicious Packages (Typosquatting, Dependency Confusion).
        *   Account Takeover of popular package maintainers.

        *   Malicious `postinstall` scripts.
        *   Protestware.
    *   **B. Defense Mechanisms and Best Practices**
        *   Vulnerability Scanning with `npm audit` / `yarn audit`.
