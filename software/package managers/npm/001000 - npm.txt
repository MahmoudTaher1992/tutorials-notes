npm
    > What is npm?
        > a huge part of js ecosystem
        > stands for node package manager
        > A place where you have millions of packages that are ready to be used in your project
        > You are going to need npm because you will never be able to build everything yourself
            > It will cost you time and mony
            > Instead you reuse packages from other developers
        > npm helps you get parts of code from other teams
        > authors write npm and publish them to npm registry
            > You can then use the package by installing it using npm cli
            > In the registry you will find all types of packages

    > Installing npm
        > Install node js and npm will be installed along side with it
        > check if it is installed or not
            > node -v
            > npm -v

    > Global and local packages
        > You can install packages locally or globally
            > Locally 
                > Only be accessible from the project 
                > use npm cli to install it
                > most packages should be installed locally
            > Globally
                > use it when you want to access the library from any place
                > most likely it is done for packages that need to be accessed from the cli
                > add "-g" to install the package globally

    > package.json
        > Store info about your project
            > name
            > version
            > github repo
        > Store info about the packages you installed
        > Run "npm install" to install all packages at once
            > npm reads the file and installs all packages
        > create a package.json file for you project using "npm init"

    > Dealing with dependencies
        > once you install the package you will see that it is added in package.json
        > you will notice that there is a folder called node_modules added
            > it contains a lot of other folders
            > even if you installed one dependency you will find a lot of other folders
                > They are the nested dependencies for the one package you installed
        > "npm list" is used to list the packages in the project and their versions 

    > Package versioning
        > The biggest source of headache while working with npm packages
        > because they depend on each other, They can cause problems
        > "npm view lib-name versions"
            > lists all versions of the library
        > First release is 1.0.0
        > Semantic versioning
            > System of numbering software versions
            > 3 digits > MajorVersion.MinorVersion.PatchVersion
                > MajorVersion
                    > Used for big changes
                    > Not Backward compatible
                    > Will probably break the old versions
                > MinorVersion
                    > Backwards-compatible features
                    > Won't break older builds
                > PatchVersion
                    > Small bug fixes
                    > Won't break older builds
                > When a version is increase the next numbers are set to ZEROs
