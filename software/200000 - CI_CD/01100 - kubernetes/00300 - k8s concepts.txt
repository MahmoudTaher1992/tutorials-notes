    > pods
        > smallest unit in kubernetes
        > can contain one or more containers
        > containers in a pod share the same network and storage, and can communicate with each other using localhost
        > is a ephemeral unit, it can be created and destroyed at any time and is not designed to be persistent or accessible
    
    > nodes
        > worker machines in the kubernetes cluster, can be physical or virtual
        > managed by the master node's control plane
        > can contain multiple pods
        > the master node's control plane manages the worker nodes to ensure the desired state of the pods on the nodes
        > can run on any cloud provider or system (windows, linux, ...)

    > a cluster
        > a set of nodes that run containerized applications
        > managed by the master node's control plane
    
    > namespaces
        > a way to tag a cluster

    > service
        > a way to expose an application running in a pod/pods to the outside world

    > deployment
        > used to tell kubernetes how to run the pods
        > can be used to scale, rollout and rollback the pods
    
    > workload
        > an application running in a pod/pods

    > volume
        > like a volume in docker
        > a way to store data in kubernetes
        > can be used to store data that needs to be persisted

    > ReplicaSet
        > a way to ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time

    > Ingress
        > an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster typically HTTP and HTTPS traffic

    > orchestration
        > the automation of much of the operations required to run a containerized application
