### B. Load Balancing
- Introduction to Load Balancing Concepts.
- Load Balancing Policies: `random`, `round_robin`, `least_conn`, `ip_hash`, etc.
- Health Checks: Active and Passive Monitoring of Backends.
- Session Persistence ("Sticky Sessions") with `ip_hash`.

### C. Advanced Proxying Patterns
- WebSocket Proxying.
- gRPC Proxying.
- Circuit Breaking to Prevent Cascading Failures.
- Retries and Timeouts for Improved Resiliency.

## Part V: Request Handling & Routing

### A. Routing and Matching
- Path-Based Routing.
- Host-Based Routing (Virtual Hosts).
- Method-Based Routing.
- Header and Query Parameter Matching.

### B. Rewrites and Redirects
- The `rewrite` Directive for Internal URL Rewriting.
- The `redir` Directive for HTTP Redirects (3xx Status Codes).
- Conditional Rewrites and Redirects.

### C. Error Handling
- The `handle_errors` Directive for Custom Error Pages.
- Serving Static Error Pages.
- Proxying to an Error Handling Service.

## Part VI: Serving Static Content

### A. Static File Server
- Basic `file_server` Usage.
- Directory Browsing.
- Index Files.
- Serving Single-Page Applications (SPAs).

### B. Performance Optimization
- Caching Headers (`Cache-Control`, `Expires`).
- ETag Headers for Conditional Requests.
- Pre-compressing Static Assets.

## Part VII: Security & Access Control

### A. Hardening Caddy
- Disabling Server Tokens.
- Setting Security-Related HTTP Headers (`X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`).
- Limiting Request Body Size.
- Rate Limiting to Mitigate Abuse.

### B. Access Control
- Basic Authentication (`basic_auth`).
- IP-Based Access Control.
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Client Certificate Authentication.

## Part VIII: Logging, Metrics & Monitoring
