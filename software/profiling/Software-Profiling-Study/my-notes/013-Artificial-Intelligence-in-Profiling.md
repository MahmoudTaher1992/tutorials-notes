# Automated Anomaly Detection in Profiling

*   setup the AI to detect the Anomaly automatically in a pipeline format
*   comparing code behavior before and after a deployment, to identify what parts of the code changes that caused Anomalies
*   AI can scan enormous amounts of data to give you the cause of the performance issue
*   it can also give you the type of anomalies
*   without the AI, you will know it the hard way, and after the big ball of mud is formed

# "Code Recommendations"

*   giving the AI the relevant code (i.e. code changes in a MR/PR that cause the anomaly), will help you suggest best fixes
*   it can also give you recommendations without knowing the codebase, but that will not as accurate as knowing the code
