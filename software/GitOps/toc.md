# GitOps: Comprehensive Study Table of Contents

## Part I: GitOps Fundamentals & Core Principles

### A. Introduction to GitOps
-   **What is GitOps?**: A modern approach to continuous delivery for cloud-native applications, using Git as the single source of truth.
-   **Core Philosophy**: Treating infrastructure as code, where the desired state of the system is declared and version-controlled in Git.
-   **The Four Key Principles of GitOps**:
    1.  **Declarative Configuration**: The system's desired state is expressed declaratively.
    2.  **Versioned and Immutable**: The desired state is stored in a way that enforces immutability and versioning, with a complete version history.
    3.  **Pulled Automatically**: An automated agent pulls the declared state from the source.
    4.  **Continuously Reconciled**: Software agents constantly observe the actual system state and attempt to apply the desired state.
-   **GitOps vs. Traditional CI/CD**: Understanding the shift from push-based to pull-based deployment models.
-   **Benefits of GitOps**: Enhanced developer experience, increased productivity, improved security, and greater reliability and stability.

### B. The GitOps Workflow
-   **The Core Loop**: Developer commits to Git -> CI pipeline builds and tests -> A GitOps agent detects changes and updates the cluster.
-   **Components of a GitOps Workflow**:
    -   **Git Repository**: The single source of truth for both application and infrastructure code.
    -   **Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline**: Automates the building and testing of code.
    -   **GitOps Operator/Agent**: The in-cluster component that synchronizes the desired state from Git.
    -   **Container Registry**: Stores immutable container images.
-   **Push vs. Pull-Based Pipelines**:
    -   **Push**: Traditional CI/CD pipelines push changes to the Kubernetes cluster.
    -   **Pull**: A GitOps agent within the cluster pulls changes from the Git repository.
-   **Change Management and Auditing**: Leveraging pull/merge requests for reviewing and approving infrastructure changes.
