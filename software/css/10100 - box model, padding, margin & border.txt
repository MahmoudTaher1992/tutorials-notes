    > it consists of 
        > margin
            > space goes around the border
        > border
        > padding
            > space around the content
        > content
            > where text and image appear
    > Width and Height of an Element
        > the normal width and height is given to the content-box
        > you can change that to the border box by setting the following
            > box-sizing: border-box;
