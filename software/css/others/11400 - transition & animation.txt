transition
    > allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration
    > To create a transition effect, you must specify two things
        > the CSS property you want to add an effect to
        > the duration of the effect
    > i.e.
        div {
            transition: width 2s, height 4s;
        }
    > props
        > transition-property
            > Specifies the name of the CSS property the transition effect is for
        > transition-duration
            > Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds a transition effect takes to complete
        > transition-timing-function
            > specifies the speed curve of the transition effect
            > values
                > ease
                > linear
                > ease-in
                > ease-out
                > ease-in-out
        > transition-delay
            > specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect

animation
    > lets an element gradually change from one style to another
    > props
        > keyframes
            > describes the animation stages that will happen during the animation
            > i.e.
                @keyframes example {
                    0%   {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
                    25%  {background-color:yellow; left:200px; top:0px;}
                    50%  {background-color:blue; left:200px; top:200px;}
                    75%  {background-color:green; left:0px; top:200px;}
                    100% {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
                }
        > animation-delay
            > Specifies a delay for the start of an animation
        > animation-direction
            > Specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles
        > animation-duration
            > Specifies how long time an animation should take to complete one cycle
        > animation-iteration-count
            > Specifies the number of times an animation should be played
        > animation-name
            > Specifies the name of the @keyframes animation
        > animation-timing-function
            > Specifies the speed curve of the animation
        > animation-play-state
            > Specifies whether the animation is running or paused
