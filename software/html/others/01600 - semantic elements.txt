semantic elements
    > elements with a meaningful name
    > i.e.
        <article>
        <aside>
        <details>
        <figcaption>
        <figure>
        <footer>
        <header>
        <main>
        <mark>
        <nav>
        <section>
        <summary>
        <time>

    > non-semantic elements
        > elements with no meaning
        > i.e.
            > div
            > span

    > section
        > A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.

    > article
        > independent, self-contained content.
        > An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.

    > section can be nested inside articles and vise versa

    > header
        > represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links

    > footer
        > defines a footer for a document or section

    > nav
        > defines a set of navigation links

    > aside
        > element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar)
        > content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content
