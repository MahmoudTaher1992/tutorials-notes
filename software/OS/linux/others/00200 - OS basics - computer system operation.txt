Computer system operation
    > to understand os you have to have some knowledge of computer system

    > a modern computer system consists of
        > CPU/s
            > brain of the computer
            > processing part of the computer
            > small ship embedded in the motherboard
        > device controllers
            > each controller is responsible for a specific type of devices
            > Disk controllers
                > hard disks
            > USB controllers
                > mouse
            > Video adapter/controllers
                > monitors
        > connected through a common bus that provides access to shared memory
            > the CPU and controllers work concurrently competing for memory cycle
            > memory controller organize the access to the memory

    > important terms
        > Bootstrap Program
            > is the initial program that runs when the computer turns on
            > it is stored in the ROM
            > it must know where the OS exists and runs it
            > it must locate and load the kernal into the memory

        > Interrupt
            > event raised by the hardware send through the system bus
            > informs the CPU to stop what is it is doing and finish the new work (interrupt)

        > System Call/Monitor Call
            > an interrupt sent from a software (not a hardware)

    > when the CPU is interrupted , it stops what it is doing and executes the interrupt
        > the interrupt has a starting address of the service routine
        > the CPU executes the service routine at the specified address
        > after the interrupt is executed the CPU returns to do what it was doing before
