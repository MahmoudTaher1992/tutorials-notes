-   **Package Management**: The Ports Collection vs. binary packages (`pkg`).
-   **System Administration**: Jails (containerization), ZFS (file system), and security features.
-   **Networking**: Configuration and management of network services.
-   **Kernel Customization**: When and why to build a custom kernel.

### B. OpenBSD
-   **Focus on Security**: Proactive security, exploit mitigation techniques.
-   **Core Components**: OpenSSH, PF (Packet Filter firewall), and other integrated tools.
-   **Installation and Maintenance**: Emphasis on a clean and secure base install.
-   **Use Cases**: Ideal for firewalls, VPN gateways, and secure servers.

### C. NetBSD
-   **Portability as a Priority**: "Of course it runs NetBSD".
-   **Supported Architectures**: A wide range of hardware platforms.
-   **Package Management**: Using `pkgsrc`.
-   **Embedded Systems and Niche Hardware**: Where NetBSD shines.

## Part IV: The Linux Ecosystem
