    > is an essential task in dealing with files in linux
    
    > cut
        > allows you to cut out sections from each line of a file

    > paste
        > combine lines from two files by columns not by lines

    > sort
        > sort the contents of a file (using the ASCII values)
        > takes the input as a file and outputs the sorted content to the stdout

    > tr
        > translate or substitutes characters
        > i.e.
            > echo 'hello' | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
                > HELLO

    > head
        > allows the user to output the first part of a file (head)
        > lets you examine the beginning of a file without loading the entire file into memory
        
    > tail
        > allows the user to output the last part of a file (tail)
        > lets you examine the end of a file without loading the entire file into memory

    > join
        > combine lines from two files by lines not by columns

    > split
        > splits a file into smaller files

    > pipe
        > connect 2 or more commands together
        > the output of the first command is the input of the second command
        > i.e.
            > ls -l | grep 'txt'

    > tee
        > reads from standard input and writes to standard output and files

    > nl
        > number lines of a file
        > takes the file as input and outputs the file with each line numbered

    > wc
        > word count
        > counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file
        > i.e.
            > wc test-001.txt
                > 27     282    1647 test-001.txt

    > expand
        > convert tabs to spaces
        > i.e.
            > expand -t 4 test-001.txt

    > unexpand
        > opposite of expand

    > uniq
        > removes duplicate lines from a file or stdin

    > grep
        > stands for (Global Regular Expression Print)
        > search for a pattern in a file, and print the lines that contain the pattern
        > i.e.
            > grep "pattern" fileName

    > awk
        > a powerful programming language for manipulating files
        > the command is named after the authors Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan
        > i.e.
            > awk '{print $1}' test-001.txt
                > prints the first column of the file
