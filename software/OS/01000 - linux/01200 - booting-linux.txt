Booting Linux
    > refers to the process that the Linux operating system undergoes when a computer system is powered on
    > when you press the power button
        > the system boot loader is loaded into memory from a specific location
        > starts the main OS
        > the process includes several stages
            > POST (Power-On Self Test)
            > MBR (Master Boot Record)
            > GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)
            > Kernel, Init process
            > the GUI or command line interface where users interact.

        > during  this process
            > the system checks for hardware components
            > loads the necessary drivers
            > mounts the file system
            > necessary services and process are started
            > the user is presented with a login screen

    > Logs
        > help admins to troubleshoot issues
        > documents every thing
        > boot time is logged in /var/log/boot.log
        > Many Linux distributions use systemd logging system, journalctl

    > Boot loader
        > loads the kernal of the OS into memory
            > the kernal then initializes the hardware and loads the drivers
            > starts the schedular and the init process
        > i.e.
            > LILO
            > GRUB
        > Allows to change between different OSs installed on the same machine
