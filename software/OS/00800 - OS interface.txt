        > some operating systems include the command interpreter in the kernel
            > kernel is the heart of the os
        > others treat the command interpreter as a separate program
            > i.e.
                > windows
                > UNIX
        > some systems have more than one command interpreter
            > i.e.
                > bourne shell
                > c shell
                > bourne-again shell (BASH)
                > korn shell

        > performing task approaches
            > some shells have the commands built in and they execute it directly
            > others have the commands in external programs and the shell only calls those programs
                > i.e.
                    > zsh
                        > it calls and external programs
