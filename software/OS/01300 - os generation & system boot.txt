OS generation & system boot
    > OS must be designed in such a way that it can fit in a variety of systems, AKA configurable OS.
    > Not all the systems are the same, so the os must be configured on each system.
    > System generation (SYSGEN) is the process used to configure an OS for a specific system.
        > some info to be generated by SYSGEN
            > CPU is to be used
            > memory capacity
            > available devices
            > custom OS options

    > Installing OS on a system means 
        1. generating a specific OS that matches the computer system
        2. copying the OS the the storage device

    > System boot
        > Boot is teh procedure of loading the kernel of the OS into the memory
        > the hardware don't know how to load the kernel
        > the bootstrap program/loader takes care of this
            > it locates the kernel
            > loads it into the memory
            > this process is called BOOTING
        > the bootstrap is in the ROM (Read only memory)
            > ROM can not be affected by the viruses because it is readonly
