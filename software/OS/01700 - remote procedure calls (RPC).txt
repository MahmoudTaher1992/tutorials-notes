RPC
    > RPC is a request-response protocol
    > it follows under client-server interaction
    > it is a form of inter-process communication

    > it is a protocol used by a program to execute a procedure in another program in a different host, as if it is running locally
    > a message is sent to the remote process with the details of the task, a reply is delivered with the results.
    > RPC provides a higher level abstraction that allows the developers to deal with the remote process easily without the need to take care of the communications details
    
    > implementation
        > Sun RPC in UNIX
        > DCOM & CORBA in microsoft

    > a glance of the stub
        > when a program using the RPC framework is compiled, stubs are created for each remote procedure
            > stub is a piece of code that handles the communication
        > two stubs are created for each procedure, one in the client side and the other is on the server side
        > when the client program calls a RPC, the call is forwarded to the stub which locates the port and sends an appropriate message to the server's stub
        > the server's stub receives the message, unpacks it and forwards it to the server program
        > the return message is created after the procedure is executed and sent back to the client using the same path
