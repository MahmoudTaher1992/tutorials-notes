# Benchmarking Philosophy

- **Why Benchmark?**: Capacity planning, regression testing, tuning verification
- **The Risks**: "Benchmarking is easy; benchmarking *correctly* is hard."
- **Benchmarking Crimes** (Common mistakes):
    - Testing the cache (working set fits in RAM when testing Disk)
    - Using default tool configurations
    - Ignoring errors during the test
    - Comparing apples to oranges
