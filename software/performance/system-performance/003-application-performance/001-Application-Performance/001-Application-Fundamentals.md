# Application Fundamentals

- **Performance Objectives**
    - Latency (Response time)
    - Throughput (Operations per second)
    - Resource efficiency (Cost reduction)
- **Core Principles**
    - **Optimize the Common Case**: Focusing efforts where they yield the highest ROI
    - **Observability Support**: Adding hooks and metrics during development
    - **Big O Notation**: Understanding algorithmic complexity (Time vs. Space)
- **Programming Language Impact**
    - **Compiled Languages** (C, C++, Rust, Go): CPU interaction, manual memory management
    - **Interpreted Languages** (Python, Ruby, JavaScript): Interpreter overhead, Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
    - **Virtual Machines** (Java/JVM, Erlang/BEAM): The "Process within a Process" model
    - **Garbage Collection (GC)**: The performance cost of automatic memory management (Stop-the-world pauses)
