# The Systems Performance Context

- **The Performance Environment**
    - Complexity: Systems, cloud, and software stacks
    - Subjectivity: When is a system "slow"?
    - The "Multiple Causes" Problem
- **Roles and Responsibilities**
    - SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) vs. DevOps vs. Core Engineering
    - Crisis Management vs. Proactive Analysis
- **Core Perspectives**
    - **User Perspective**: Response time and latency
    - **Resource Perspective**: Utilization and saturation
- **Cloud Computing Implications**
    - Noisy neighbors
    - Virtualization overhead
    - Scalability vs. Performance
