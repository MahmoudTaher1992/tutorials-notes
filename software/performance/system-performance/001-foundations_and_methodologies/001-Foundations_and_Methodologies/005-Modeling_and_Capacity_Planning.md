# Modeling and Capacity Planning

- **System Models**
    - System Under Test (SUT)
    - Queueing Systems
- **Scalability Laws**
    - **Amdahl’s Law**: The limit of parallelism (serial contention)
    - **Universal Scalability Law (USL)**: Contention + Coherency (crosstalk)
- **Queueing Theory**
    - M/M/1 and M/M/c models
    - Utilization vs. Response Time curve (the "Hockey Stick")
- **Capacity Planning**
    - Resource Limits
    - Factor Analysis
    - Scaling Solutions (Vertical vs. Horizontal)
