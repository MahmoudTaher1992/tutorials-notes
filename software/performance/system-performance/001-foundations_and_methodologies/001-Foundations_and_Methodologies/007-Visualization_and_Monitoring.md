# Visualization and Monitoring

- **Pattern Recognition**
    - Time-based patterns (Daily, Weekly peaks)
    - Summary-Since-Boot analysis
- **Chart Types & Usage**
    - Line Charts (and their quantization issues)
    - Scatter Plots (visualizing raw event density)
    - **Heat Maps**: Visualizing multimodal distributions and latency quantization
    - **Flame Graphs**: Visualizing stack traces and CPU profiling
    - Timeline Charts and Surface Plots
