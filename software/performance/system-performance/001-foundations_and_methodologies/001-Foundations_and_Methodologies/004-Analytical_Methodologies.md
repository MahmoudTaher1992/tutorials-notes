# Analytical Methodologies (The Frameworks)

- **The Anti-Methods** (What to avoid)
    - The "Streetlight" Anti-Method (Looking only where it's easy)
    - The "Random Change" Anti-Method (Tuning by guessing)
    - The "Blame-Someone-Else" Anti-Method
- **The Scientific Method**
    - Question -> Hypothesis -> Prediction -> Test -> Analysis
- **The Diagnosis Cycle**
    - Hypothesis generation and data collection loops
- **The USE Method** (For Resources)
    - **U**tilization, **S**aturation, **E**rrors
    - Iterating through every hardware resource
- **The RED Method** (For Services/Microservices)
    - **R**ate (Requests per second)
    - **E**rrors (Failed requests)
    - **D**uration (Latency distributions)
- **Drill-Down Analysis**
    - Starting high-level and narrowing scope (5 whys)
- **Workload Characterization**
    - Who is calling the system? Why? How often?
- **Latency Analysis**
    - Breaking down response time into components (Method R)
- **Linux Performance Analysis in 60 Seconds**
    - The essential checklist for immediate diagnosis
