# Network Analysis Methodology

- **The USE Method for Networks**:
    - Utilization (Interface throughput limits)
    - Saturation (Dropped packets, overrun queues)
    - Errors (Collisions, carrier errors)
- **Workload Characterization**: Packet rate (PPS) vs. Data rate (Bps), Protocol mix
- **Latency Analysis**: Isolating DNS vs. TCP Connect vs. Data Transfer
- **Packet Sniffing**: Inspecting headers and payloads (The ultimate source of truth)
