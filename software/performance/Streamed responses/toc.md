        *   Key Features: Unidirectional (Server-to-Client), Automatic Reconnection, Named Events
        *   The SSE Message Format: `data:`, `event:`, `id:`, `retry:`
        *   Client-Side Consumption: The browser's native `EventSource` API
        *   Ideal Use Cases: Notifications, live dashboards, status updates, news feeds
    *   **C. WebSockets**
        *   Protocol Overview: Full-duplex, bidirectional communication
        *   The Handshake: Upgrading an HTTP connection (`101 Switching Protocols`)
        *   Data Frames: Text, Binary, and Control Frames (Ping/Pong, Close)
        *   Ideal Use Cases: Real-time chat, collaborative applications, multiplayer gaming
    *   **D. HTTP/2 & HTTP/3 Native Streaming**
        *   Multiplexing: Multiple concurrent streams over a single connection
        *   Server Push (HTTP/2)
        *   Relation to higher-level protocols like gRPC streaming
        *   Trailer Headers for post-stream metadata

*   **Part III: Design & Implementation (Server-Side)**
    *   **A. Data Source Strategies**
        *   Streaming from a Database: Cursors, Iterators, and avoiding `fetchall()`
        *   Streaming from a File System or Object Storage
        *   Streaming by Proxying another Downstream Service
        *   On-the-Fly Generation: Iteratively building responses (e.g., log processing, report generation)
    *   **B. Data Formatting for Streams**
        *   **Line-Delimited Formats**
            *   NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) / JSON Lines
            *   CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
            *   Why these are ideal for streaming
        *   **Streaming Large Structured Data**
            *   The "Streaming a JSON Array" Problem and Solutions (e.g., JSON Stream)
            *   Binary Formats: Length-prefixed Protobuf or Avro messages
    *   **C. Framework-Specific Implementation Patterns**
        *   **Node.js**: `ReadableStream` and `stream.pipeline`
        *   **Python (FastAPI/Flask)**: Generator functions with `yield`
        *   **Java (Spring)**: `StreamingResponseBody`, Project Reactor (`Flux<T>`)
        *   **.NET (ASP.NET Core)**: `IAsyncEnumerable<T>`, writing directly to `HttpResponse.BodyWriter`
    *   **D. Managing Backpressure**
        *   What it is and why it's critical to prevent buffer overflows
        *   Implicit vs. Explicit Handling in Frameworks

        *   Using HTTP Trailer Headers to send a final status
    *   **B. Proxies, Load Balancers, and API Gateways**
        *   The "Buffering Problem": Disabling proxy buffering (e.g., `proxy_buffering off;` in Nginx)
        *   Connection Timeouts and Keep-Alives
        *   Protocol Support (Ensuring WebSocket/SSE traffic is not blocked or misinterpreted)
    *   **C. Security Considerations**
        *   Authentication/Authorization for Long-Lived Connections
        *   Resource Exhaustion (Denial-of-Service) attacks
        *   Validating data chunks on the client to prevent injection attacks
    *   **D. Observability & Testing**
        *   **Testing Strategies**
            *   Unit testing the stream-producing generator/logic
            *   Integration tests that consume the full stream and verify its contents
            *   Testing failure modes: slow consumers, abrupt connection closes, mid-stream errors
        *   **Monitoring & Logging**
            *   Logging the start and end of a stream, but not every chunk
            *   Metrics: Number of active connections, data transferred per stream
