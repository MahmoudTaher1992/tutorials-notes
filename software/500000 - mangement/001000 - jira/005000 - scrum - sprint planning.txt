Sprint planning
	> It is a scrum ceremony/event
	> The event that starts the Sprint
	> Done with the collaboration of the whole team
	> Purpose of the event
		> What will be done in the sprint ?
		> How will it be done ?
	> You need to decide upon the time of the sprint
	
	> The What
		> The product owner specifies a goal for the sprint
		> The product owner specifies the backlog items that will be transferred to the sprint
		> The team contributes on what can be done during the sprint

	> The How
		> The team plans the work necessary to achieve the sprint's goal
		> There may be a negotiation between the product owner and the development team

	> The Who
		> Product owner and development team should both attend the meeting
		> If either is missing the planning will be invalid

	> The Inputs
		> The product's backlog is the main input for the sprint

	> The outputs
		> The team should describe the following
			> The goal of the sprint
			> How will they achieve it

	> Prep for sprint planning
		> The product owner should be prepared with
			> Lessons from the prev sprint
			> Feedback from the stakeholders
			> Vision of the product
		> The product backlog should be groomed/updated
			> This is a main job for the product owner
			> Making the team participate in it will bring them more to the picture
				> Having it in the middle of the sprint is a good thing so that the team 
				  can have a bigger image of the situation of the project 

	> Time-boxing
		> Max of 2hrs/sprint week
			> sprint(2weeks) => 4 hrs sprint planning
		> The scrum master is the one who should monitor this

	> Focus on the outcome not the work
		> Don't sink in details (It is normal that you will not know everything from the beginning)
			> the order of the tasks
			> who should do what
			> the estimation of the tasks
	
	> Estimation
		> Any sprint planning should include estimation to the work that can be done withing the sprint
		> Estimations will be more accurate if the info about the work is detailed
		> Techniques
			> t-shirt sizing
			> story-points

	> Best practices
		> Don't sink in the details (the goal is a plan for the sprint)
		> Should not be with high details (leave a space for team members to self-organize)
		> Instead of sinking into the details (focus on the sprint goal)
		> ensure that the product's backlog is ordered

	> Scrum is a process framework aimed to solve complex problems
		> Complex problems require `learn by doing`
		> The plan will never be perfect because we are solving complex vague problems
		> The plan will focus on the goal instead of the details
