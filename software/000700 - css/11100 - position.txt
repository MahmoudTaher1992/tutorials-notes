position
    > specifies the type of positioning method used for an element
    > values
        > static
        > relative
        > fixed
        > absolute
        > sticky

    > static
        > default position
        > positioned as the normal flow of the document
        > not affected byt the left, right, top and bottom props

    > relative
        > positioned relative to its normal position
        > affected by left, right, top and bottom props

    > fixed
        > positioned relative to the viewport
        > it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled

    > absolute
        > positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
            > positioned ancestor means an ancestor with (position = relative)
        > if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling

    > sticky
        > positioned based on the user's scroll position
        > A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position
            > positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport
            > then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
