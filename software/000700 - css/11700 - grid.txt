    > Grid gaps
        > The spaces between each column/row
        > gaps can be adjusted by the following props
            > column-gap
            > row-gap
            > gap

    > Grid lines
        > The lines between columns are called column lines
        > The lines between rows are called row lines

    > Grid container
        > props
            > grid-template-columns

                > i.e.
                    grid-template-columns: 80px 200px auto 40px;
            > grid-template-rows
                > defines the number and the height of rows
                > i.e.
                    grid-template-rows: 80px 200px;
            > justify-content
                > used to align the whole grid inside the container
