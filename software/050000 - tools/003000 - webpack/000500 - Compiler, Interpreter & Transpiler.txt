Compiler, Interpreter & Transpiler
    > Compiler
        > A software that converts a programming language code into a
            > machine code
            > bytecode
                > A code that is not compiled totally (a last step is left to the user machine to do)
                    > To achieve a cross platform compatibility
                > i.e
                    > Java
                    > C#
                    > VB.NET
                    > Python
            > another programming language
        > Source code
            > High level
            > Human readable
            > i.e
                > C
                > C++
                > Objective-C
        > The act of converting the source code into a machine code is called compilation
        > The compiler specifies the errors and report them with line number
        > Once compiled it will work on one platform
        > Doesn't require resources on the user machine - faster
        > Ready to run
        > Source code is private

    > Interpreter
        > A software that receives a code as a high level language and compiles it on the run line by line
        > The code can work on different platforms as the new platform can have special interpreter
        > The machine receiving the source code must have an interpreter
        > simpler to test
        > slower - requires resources at the users machine
        > easier to debug
        > source code is public (can be uglified)
        > Source code examples
            > PHP
            > JavaScript

    > Transpiler
        > Also called source-to-source compilers
        > Is a program that converts code from high level to another high level
        > i.e.
            > If you write your code in typescript or coffeescript - the browser will not run it
            > Use babel to transpile it to es5
            > Pass it to a browser
            > It will run !!!
