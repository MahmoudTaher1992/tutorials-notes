Module Resolution
    > https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve
    > A special library that helps in locating a module by its absolute path
    > A module can be required as a dependency from another module
    > The dependency module can be from the application code or a third-party library.
    > The resolver helps webpack find the module code that needs to be included in the bundle for every such require/import statement

    > Rules
        > webpack can resolve 3 kinds of paths
            > Absolute paths
                > i.e.
                    > import '/home/me/file';
                    > import 'C:\\Users\\me\\file';
            > Relative paths
                > i.e.
                    > import '../src/file1';
                    > import './file2';
            > Module paths
                > i.e.
                    > import 'module';
                    > import 'module/lib/file';
                > Modules are searched for inside all directories specified in resolve.modules.
                > You can replace the original module path by an alternate path by creating an alias for it using 
                  the resolve.alias configuration option.
                > If the path is a  
                    > file => resolved
                    > folder
                        > search for package.json > resolve.mainFields
                        > file names specified in the resolve.mainFiles configuration option are looked for in order
                        > some other steps - lookup to know if needed
    
    > Resolving Loaders
        > This follows the same rules as those specified for file resolution
        > But the resolveLoader configuration option can be used to have separate resolution rules for loaders.

    > Caching
        > Every filesystem access is cached so that multiple parallel or serial requests to the same file occur faster
        > In watch mode, only modified files are evicted from the cache
        > If watch mode is off, then the cache gets purged before every compilation
