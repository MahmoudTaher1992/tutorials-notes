    > used to compile native addon modules for Node.js
        > Native addon modules
            > modules written in C/C++
            > C++ is much more performant than JS
            > you can integrate it in you node app and node-gyp will compile it
            > node js is written in C++, hence you can use C++ addons

        > compile
            > convert code from native code (C++) to node js compatible code

    > not used to build Node js itself
