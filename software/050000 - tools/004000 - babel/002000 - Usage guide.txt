Usage guide
    > There are quite a few tools in the Babel toolchain that try to make it easy for you to use Babel
    
    > Overview
        > Install babel packages
            > @babel/core
            > @babel/cli
        > Create a config file `babel.config.js` to the root project
            > To config babel
        > The @Babel/cli lets you use babel from the cli
        > Polyfill
            > @babel/polyfill
            > Fills the app with new js missing features in the target environment
            > @babel/polyfill will be deprecated in favor of core-js/stable
        > babel-preset-env
            > polyfills missing features in old browsers
            > if you didn't config the browserlist it will target all browsers
                > polyfills everything
                > The bundle will be huge
                > You can avoid that by narrowing down the supported browsers list
