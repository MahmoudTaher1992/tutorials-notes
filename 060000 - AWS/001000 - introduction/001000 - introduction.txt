AWS Introduction
    Clouds are tiny droplets of frozen crystals of water that are high in the sky and hovering around earth
    It provide services to earth inhabitants > rain > water
    This explanation can apply to cloud computing

    Cloud computing is a host service that are hosted somewhere far from local server and personal computer

    AWS can be used for 
        personal

        commercial

        enterprise-grade

    Clouds are of three types
        Private cloud
            > A host infrastructure, platform, application services
            > located remotely 
            > providing compute, platform & IT services
            > controlled only by one organization
            > preferred by companies that need
                > security
                > dedicated data center / hosting space
            > Constant upgrade required
                > staff skills
                > Data center infrastructure
            > High cost, High time consuming

        Public cloud
            > Same as private but it provides on-demand services on shared isolated platforms
            > Open and accessible to public for subscription
            > Helps clients to focus more in their work rather than looking after the cloud problems.
            > In cloud computing the services are provided on pay-as-you-go model
            > It can scale on short and long-term needs
            
        Hybrid cloud
            > In some situations private cloud can use public ones to meet a sudden spike in resource requirments
