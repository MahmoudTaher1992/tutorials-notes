        > event pattern
            > event source
            > target

            > once the event happens in the source, the target is triggered
            > there are lots of events sources and targets

    > Event bus
        > a component that recieves events from sources and routes them to targets
        > EventBridge evaluates the event against the rules in the event bus, and routes to the target if the event matches the rule

        > you can archive/save the events sent to the bus
        > you can replay the archived events

    > schema registry
        > EventBridge can analyze the events sent and create a schema for them
        > The schema registry can be used to create a code for the schema, the code can be used in your application logic
        > When you have a schema you can write code to handle the events

    > Resource-based Policy
        > manage permissions for the event bus
        > i.e.
            > allow/deny events from a specific account/region
        > use case
            > aggregate all the events from all the accounts in the organization to a single event bus
