Monitoring, Logging and Tracing
    > Logging and Tracing
        > CloudWatch logs
            > logs contain information about the request/response body
            > logs can be enabled at the stage level
        
        > X-Ray
            > enables tracing
            > X-RAY API gateway + Lambda give the full picture of what's happening

    > CloudWatch Metrics
        > by stage
        > ability to enable detailed metrics
        > i.e.
            > CacheHitCount, CacheMissCount
                > efficiency of the cache
            > Count
                > API requests count in a givin period
            > IntegrationLatency
                > time taken to send the request and receive a response with the backend
            > Latency
                > time taken from receiving the request from a user and sending the response back
            > 4XXError, 5XXError
                > number of errors

    > Throttling
        > Account limit is 10,000 requests per second across all APIs
            > limit can be increased by contacting AWS
        > an error will be thrown 
            > 429 - Too Many Requests
        > Can configure stage limit, method limit to improve performance
        > Can define usage plan to throttle per user

        > if one API is throttled, all the other APIs will be throttled as well

    > errors
        > 4XX
            > client errors
        > 5XX
            > server errors
