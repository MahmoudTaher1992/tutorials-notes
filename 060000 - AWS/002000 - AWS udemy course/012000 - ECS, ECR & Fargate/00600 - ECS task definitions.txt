ECS task definitions
    > task definitions are metadata in JSON format that describe how a container should be run
    > crucial information in the metadata
        > image name    
        > port binding for container and host
        > memory and CPU requirements
        > environment variables
        > logging configuration
        > IAM role
        > networking information

    > you can define up to 10 containers in a task definition
    
    > Port mappings
        > EC2 launch type
            > ports from the EC2 host will be dynamic
            > Application load balancer is designed to know the dynamic ports and connect to them
            > you must allow the ALB to connect to the EC2 instances on all ports (as the ports are dynamic)

        > Fargate launch type
            > each task will have it's own unique private IP address
            > only define the container port
            > the application load balancer will connect to the container port directly

    > IAM role definition
        > you will add the role definition in the task definition
        > a new role will be created for each task definition

    > Environment variables
        > hardcoded
        > SSM parameter store
        > secrets manager

        > you will define it in the task definition and it will be fetched and passed to the container

    > Data volumes
        > share data between containers in the same task
        > works for both EC2 and Fargate launch types
        > EC2 task
            > using the host EC2 instance storage
            > data are tied to the lifecycle of the EC2 instance
        > Fargate task
            > using any storage
                > EBS
                > EFS
                > ephemeral storage (storage from fargate)
