ECS
    > AWS elastic container service

    > ECS task
        > a definition of application
        > contains one or more containers

    > ECS service
        > allows you to run and maintain a specified number of tasks simultaneously in an ECS cluster
        > if any of the tasks failed or stopped for any reason the schedular will launch another task for you to keep the desired amount of tasks running
        > the schedular can be configured with many strategies
        
        > it is ideal to run a service for long running tasks
            > i.e.
                > web servers
                > application servers

    > ECS cluster
        > a group of ECS tasks or services

        > you can setup container insights on a cluster to monitor the cluster
            > container insights is a feature of cloudwatch
            > it will monitor the cluster and provide metrics and logs

    > AWS Cloud Map
        > a cloud resource discovery service
        > in microservices a service needs to discover the location of other services 
        > AWS cloud map helps in this by
            > keeping track of all the services
            > keeping metadata about the services
            > keeping track of other info about the services
                > i.e.
                    > health status
                    > location
                    > ...

        > when a service needs the location of another service, it can query the cloud map
