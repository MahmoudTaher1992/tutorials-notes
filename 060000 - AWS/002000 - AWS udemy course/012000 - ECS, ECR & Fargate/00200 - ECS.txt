ECS
    > AWS elastic container service

    > ECS task
        > a definition of application
        > contains one or more containers

    > ECS service
        > allows you to run and maintain a specified number of tasks simultaneously in an ECS cluster
        > if any of the tasks failed or stopped for any reason the schedular will launch another task for you to keep the desired amount of tasks running
        > the schedular can be configured with many strategies
        
        > it is ideal to run a service for long running tasks
            > i.e.
                > web servers
                > application servers

    > ECS cluster
        > a group of ECS tasks or services

        > you can setup container insights on a cluster to monitor the cluster
            > container insights is a feature of cloudwatch
            > it will monitor the cluster and provide metrics and logs

    > AWS Cloud Map
        > a cloud resource discovery service
        > in microservices a service needs to discover the location of other services 
        > AWS cloud map helps in this by
            > keeping track of all the services
            > keeping metadata about the services
            > keeping track of other info about the services
                > i.e.
                    > health status
                    > location
                    > ...

        > when a service needs the location of another service, it can query the cloud map


    > ECS launch types
        > EC2
            > you must provision and maintain the infrastructure
            > each ec2 instance must run the ECS agent
            > ECS will take it from there, start and stop containers as needed on the EC2 instances

        > Fargate
            > ECS will take care of provisioning and maintaining the infrastructure
            > it is serverless
            > you configure it by creating the task definitions

    > ECS task 
        > IAM roles
            > roles should be given to the ECS agent to deal with other AWS services
                > i.e.
                    > cloudwatch
                    > ECS
                    > ECR
                    > secrets manager
                    > SSM parameter store
                    > ...
            > roles should be given to
                > ECS agent
                > ECS task
                    > each task should have it's own distinguished role

        > load balancer integration
            > you can integrate the ECS service with a load balancer
                > application load balancer
                > network load balancer
            > the load balancer will distribute the traffic to the tasks
            > you can make the public call the load balancer and then it will be directed to the tasks

    > ECS data volumes
        > you can use EFS to share data between tasks (across all zones)
        > works with both launch types
        > share storage between containers
        > amazon s3 can not be mounted as a file system
