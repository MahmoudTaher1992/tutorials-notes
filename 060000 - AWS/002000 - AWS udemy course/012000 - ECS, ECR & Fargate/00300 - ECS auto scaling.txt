ECS auto scaling
    > automatically increase/decrease the desired number of ECS tasks
    > ECS auto scaling uses AWS application auto scaling
        > scaling based on
            > CPU utilization
            > memory utilization
            > request count per application (from load balancer)
    
    > auto scaling types
        > target tracking scaling
            > scale based on target value for a specific cloudwatch metric
                > metrics are the 3 metrics mentioned above
        > step scaling 
            > scale based on cloud watch alarms
        > scheduled scaling
            > scale based on a schedule

    > ECS scaling is different than EC2 auto scaling
        > ECS scaling is much easier

    > Launch type auto scaling
        > EC2 Launch type
            > ECS will add EC2 instances to the ECS cluster
                > Auto scaling group scaling
                    > scale your ASG based on CPU utilization
                    > add EC2 instances over time
                > ECS cluster capacity provider
                    > used to automatically provision and scale the infrastructure of the ECS task
                    > Capacity provider paired with ASG
                    > add EC2 instances when your are missing capacity

    > auto scaling lifecycle
        > when the value of the metric increases, it fires an alarm
        > the alarm is picked up by the AWS application auto scaling
        > it spins up a new ECS tasks or shuts down one
