AWS CloudWatch metrics
    > CloudWatch provides metrics for every service in AWS
    > Metric is a variable/info to monitor
        > i.e.
            > CPUUtilization
            > NetworkIn
            > ...
        > the data is stored as statistics

    > namespaces
        > containers for metrics
        > each metric should be in a namespace
        > Metrics belong to namespaces

    > Dimension is an attribute of a metric
        > i.e.
            > InstanceId
            > InstanceType
            > AutoScalingGroupName
        > Up to 30 dimensions per metric
    > Metrics have timestamps
    > Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics

    > EC2 detailed monitoring
        > EC2 instance metrics have metrics "every 5 minutes"
        > With detailed monitoring (for a cost), you get data "every 1 minute"
        > The free tier includes 10 detailed monitoring metrics
        > Note
            > EC2 memory usage is not pushed by default
            > You need to push your own custom metrics

    > Custom metrics
        > you can collect any data you want from your applications by pushing them to CloudWatch using the SDK
        > i.e.
            > how many purchases have been made
            > how many users logged in in a period of time
            > ...

    > Alarms based on metrics
        > you can setup an alarm that will notify you when a metrics goes beyond a threshold
