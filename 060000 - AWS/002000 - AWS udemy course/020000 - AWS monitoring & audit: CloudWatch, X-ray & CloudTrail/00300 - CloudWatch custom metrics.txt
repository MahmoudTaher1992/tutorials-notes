CloudWatch custom metrics
    > possibility to define and send custom metrics to CloudWatch
    > i.e.
        > Memory usage (RAM)
        > Disk space
        > Number of logged users

    > Done by using PutMetricData API call
    > Ability to use dimensions to segment metrics
        > i.e. Instance.id, InstanceType, etc.

    > Metric resolution
        > Standard: 1 minute
        > High resolution: up to 1 second (higher cost)

    > Custom metrics accept data that are 2 weeks in the past or 2 hours in the future

    > you can use the aws-cli or aws-cdk to push the custom metrics
