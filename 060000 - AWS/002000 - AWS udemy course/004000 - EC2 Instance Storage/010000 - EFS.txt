EFS (Elastic File System)
    > Managed NFS (Network File System) that can be mounted on many EC2
        > NFS
            > A protocol that lets users on a computer access files on the Network
            > Any one on the network will have access to the files
            > The system can use security protocols to dictate privileges (Who does what)
    > Works across multi AZ
        > Multiple EC2 instances on different AZs can access the NFS
    > Highly available, scalable, expensive, pay per use
    > Use cases
        > Content management
        > Web serving
        > Data sharing
        > Wordpress
    > Uses NFSv4.1 protocol
    > Uses security groups to control access to EFS
    > Compatible with Linux based AMI (NOT WINDOWS)
    > Encryption at rest using KMS
    > POSIX file system (~Linux) that has a standard file API
    > File system scales automatically, pay-per-use, no-capacity planning 

    > EFS Scale
        > 1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10GB/s + throughput
        > Grow to Petabyte-scale network file system, automatically

    > Performance mode (at creation time)
        > General purpose: latency-sensitive

                > Web server
                > CMS
        > Max I/O
            > higher latency
            > higher throughput

    > Throughput mode
        > Bursting:
            > 1 TB = 50MiB/s
            > + burst of up to 100 MiB/s
        > Provisioned
            > Enter your throughput regardless of storage size

    > Storage tiers
        > lifecycle management feature
        > move file after N days
        > tiers
            > Standard - Frequently accessed files
            > Infrequent access (EFS-IA)
                > Cost to retrieve files
                > lower price to store
                > Enable EFS-IA with a Lifecycle Policy
                    > if a file is not accessed after 60 days it will move to EFS-IA tier
    
    > Availability and durability
        > Standard
            > Multi-AZ - great for production
        > One Zone
            > One AZ
            > Great for dev, backup
            > Enabled by default
            > compatible with IA > (EFS One Zone-IA)

    > You can get over 90% savings if you customize the options of EFS
