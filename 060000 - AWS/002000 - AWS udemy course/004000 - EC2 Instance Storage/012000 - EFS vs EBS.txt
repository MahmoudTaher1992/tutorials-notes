EFS vs EBS
    > EBS
        > can be only attached to one instance at a time
            > except for io1/io2 family they can be attached to multiple instance but in the same AZ
        > Locked in the AZ
        > pg2 - IO increases if hte disk size increases
        > io - can increase IO independently
        
        > To migrate EBS across AZ
            > take a snapshot
            > restore snapshot to another AZ
            > EBS use IO and you shouldn't run them while your app is handling a lot of traffic 

        > Root EBS volumes get terminated by default if the EC2 instance gets terminated (you can disable that)
    
    > EFS
        > Can be mounted to 100s of instances across AZ
        > Only for Linux instances (POSIX)
        > EFS has a higher price point than EBS
        > Can leverage EFS-IA for cost savings

    > Instance store
        > gets you the highest IO performance but with high risk of losing the data
