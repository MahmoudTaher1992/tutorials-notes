EBS Overview
    > What is EBS volume ?
        > EBS stands for (Elastic Block Volume)
        > It is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
            > Not a physical drive
            > It uses the network to communicate the instance - There might be a bit of latency
        > It allows instances to persist data, even after their termination
        > They can be only mounted at one instance at a time
        > They are bound to a specific AZ
            > But there is a way to move it around AZs using snapshots
        > Analogy (Think of them as a network USB stick)
        > Free tier - 30 GB of free EBS storage SSD/Magnetic per month
        > You get billed for all the capacity
            > Not for the used capacity only!
        > You can increase the capacity by the time

        > Delete on termination attribute
            > deletes when ec2 instance terminates
