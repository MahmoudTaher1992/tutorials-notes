SQS message visibility timeout
    > after a message is polled from the queue by the consumer, it becomes invisible to other consumers for a defined period of time
    > this time is called the visibility timeout
    > if the job was not deleted after the visibility timeout, it will become visible again and another consumer

    > default value is 30 seconds

    > the consumer can extend the visibility timeout for a message
        > by calling ChangeMessageVisibility api 

    > you can increase the visibility timeout
        > as you increase
            > you face the problem of delays if the consumer crashes
        > as you decrease
            > you will face a duplication problem if the consumer did't extend the time
