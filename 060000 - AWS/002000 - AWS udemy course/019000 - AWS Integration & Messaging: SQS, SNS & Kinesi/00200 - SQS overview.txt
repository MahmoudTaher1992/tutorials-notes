SQS overview
    > SQS is a queue service

    > used to decouple apps

    > attributes
        > unlimited throughput, you can send messages as much as you want
        > unlimited number of messages 
        > default retention of the message is from 4 days to 14 days at max
        > low latency (in less than 10 ms on publish and receive)
        > max message size is 256 KB

    > can have duplicate messages
    > can have out of order messages

    > producer
        > producer send messages to the queue using SDK
        > the message is persisted to the SQS until a consumer deletes it
        > message retention: 4-14 days
        > unlimited throughput

    > consumer
        > consumer poll messages from the queue (10 msgs at a time)
        > process the message
        > delete the message using the SDK

        > multiple consumers
            > consumers receive messages in parallel
            > once the message is delivered to a consumer, it becomes invisible to other consumers for some time (visibility timeout)
        
            > auto scaling the consumers by ASG
                > you can use the SQS metric to scale the ASG

    > usage example
        > decouple the components of an application
        > take the logic of video conversion outside of the main application
        > put it in a processing unit (EC2 instance, lambda, etc)
        > setup ASG
        > connect it to SQS
        > the app will send a message and it will be handled automatically at any scale

    > security
        > encryption
            > in-flight
            > at rest

        > access control
            > IAM policies

        > SQS access policies
            > similar to S3 bucket policies
