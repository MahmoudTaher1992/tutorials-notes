CloudFront overview
    > it is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
    > improves the read performance by caching the data at the edge
    > improves user experience
    > there are 216 edge points and they are increasing
    > it provides a protection against DDos because it is hard to attach the 216 points at once

    > origins
        > S3 bucket
            > for distributing files and caching them on the edge
            > enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control
            > CloudFront can be used to upload files
        > Custom Origin (HTTP)
            > Application Load Balancer
            > EC2 instance
            > S3 website 
            > any HTTP backend you want

    > how it works
        > the clients requests from the edge
        > if not found in the edge location, the edge will request it from the origin and cache it
        > it will serve it to the requester and continuo serving it until it's TTL expires

    > CloudFront vs S3 cross region replication
        > CloudFront
            > Data will be in the Global Edge Network
            > Files are cached for a TTL
            > great for static content

        > S3 cross region replication
            > must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
            > files are updated in real time
            > read only
            > great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low latency in few regions
