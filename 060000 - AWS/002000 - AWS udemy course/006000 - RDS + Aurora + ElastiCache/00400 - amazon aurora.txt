Amazon Aurora
    > not an open source db
    > owned by aws, you can not find it except on aws
    > is optimized and 5x performance improvement on AWS MySQL and 3x performance improvement on AWS Postgres
    > automatic storage increments (of 10GB), up to 128GB
    > can have 15 replicas
    > failover is the fastest among siblings, almost instantaneous
    > cost more than RDS by 20%, but more efficient

    > High availability and read scaling
        > data is stored in 3AZs (6 copies)
        > self healing by peer to peer replication
    > one aurora instance (master) takes writes and all the others takes reads
    > automatic failover (in 30 seconds at most)
    > up to 15 read replicas
        > you can setup it to be auto scaling
        > there is a reader endpoint that is connected to load balancer to control the scaling

    > Features
        > automatic failover
        > backup and recovery
        > isolation and security
        > industry compliance
        > push-button scaling
        > automated patching with 0 downtime
        > advanced monitoring
        > routine maintenance
        > backtrack => restore data at any point of time without using backups
