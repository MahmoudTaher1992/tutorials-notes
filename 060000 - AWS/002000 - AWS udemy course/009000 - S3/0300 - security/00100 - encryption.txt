Encryption
    > encryption methods
        > server side encryption (SSE)
            > SSE with S3 managed keys
                > encryption keys are created, maintained and owned by AWS
            > SSE with KMS
                > encryption keys are managed by AWS key management service
            > SSE with customer provided keys
                > encryption keys are managed and supplied by the customer
        > client side encryption

    > SSE-S3
        > encryption keys are created, maintained and owned by AWS
        > objects are encrypted in the server side
        > encryption types is AES-256
        > must set header
            > "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES-256"
        > ENABLED BY DEFAULT FOR NEW BUCKETS AND NEW OBJECTS

    > SSE-KMS
        > encryption keys are managed by AWS key management service
        > objects are encrypted in the server side
        > must set header
            > "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"

        > limitations
            > you may be impacted by KMS limits
            > when you upload/download a file you send a request to the KMS-API
            > if the KMS quota is exceeded you can request an increase or apply Exponential Back-off technique

    > SSE-C
        > encryption keys are managed and supplied by the customer
        > keys are stored outside AWS
        > encryption key must be provided in each request
        > HTTPS is a must in this case

    > client side encryption
        > client manages the encryption/decryption full cycle
        > client can use any encryption tool 
            > i.e.
                > AWS S3 client side encryption library

    > encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)
        > AWS S3 exposes two endpoints 
            > HTTP
                > non encrypted
            > HTTPS
                > encryption in flight
                > recommended
                > is a must in SSE-C
                > most clients are using this by default

        > you can force encryption in transit by attaching a policy to the bucket
