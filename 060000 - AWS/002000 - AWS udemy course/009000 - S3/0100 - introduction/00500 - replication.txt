Replication
    > can be done by
        > Cross region replication (CRR)
        > Same region replication (SRR)

    > must enable versioning in source and destination buckets
    > buckets can be in different AWS accounts
    > copying is async
    > S3 must have a proper IAM permissions

    > use cases
        > CRR
            > compliance
            > lower latency
        > SRR
            > log aggregation
            > live replication between production and test accounts

    > after enabling replication, only new objects will be replicated
        > you can replicate existing objects using S3 batch replication
            > it can also be used for failed objects
        > can replicate delete markers

    > there is no chaining in replication
        > i.e.
            > bucket1 is replicated to bucket2, and bucket2 is replicated to bucket3. then bucket1 will not be replicated to bucket3
