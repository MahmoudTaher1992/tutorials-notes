    > Durability 
        > there is highly available
        > if you store 10 million, you may expect to lose one object each 1000 years
        > same for all storage classes
    > Availability
        > measures how readily available the service is
        > varies for different storage classes

    > S3 standard - General Purpose
        > 99.99% Availability
        > used for frequently accessed data
        > low latency and high throughput
        > sustain 2 concurrent facility failures
        > use cases
            > big data analytics
            > mobile and gaming applications

    > Infrequent access
        > less frequent accessed data
        > rapid access when needed
        > lower cost than S3 standard
