Versioning
    > S3 allows Versioning
    > it is enabled in the bucket level
    > if you overwrite the key, a new version will be created
    
    > pros
        > protects against unintended deletion (with the ability to restore a version)
        > easy rollback to prev versions

    > notes
        > any file that is not versioned prior versioning activation will have a null version
        > deactivating versioning will not delete the prev versions
