S3 performance
    > AWS S3 automatically scales to high request rates and low latency 100-200 ms
    > you can achieve
        > 3500 PUT/POST/DELETE/COPY per second per prefix
        > 5500 GET/HEAD per second per prefix

        > prefix is the path between the bucket name and the file name
        > there is no limit for the number of prefixes in a bucket

    > Multi part upload 
        > recommended for files > 100MB
        > must for files > 5GB

        > can help parallelize uploads to speed up the upload
            > the file will be divided into smaller files and will be uploaded

    > S3 transfer acceleration
        > increase transfer speed by transferring file into edge location, and it will be transferred with higher speed from there
        > edge location is a place which has a high speed private connection with the target S3 service
        > compatible with multipart upload
        
    > S3 byte ranges fetches
        > parallelize GETs by requesting specific byte ranges
        > can be used to speed the downloads
        > can be used to used to retrieve some parts of the file (use it if you want to get the header of the file for example)
