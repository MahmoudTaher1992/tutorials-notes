Elastic Load Balancing - Overview
    > They are servers that forward traffic to multiple servers (i.e. EC2 instances) downstream

    > Why use load balancer?
        > Spread load across multiple downstream instances 
        > Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your app
        > Handle failures of downstream instances
        > Do regular health checks to your instances
        > Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
        > Enforce stickiness with cookies
        > High availability across zones
        > Separate public traffic from private traffic

    > Why use an Elastic Load balancer
        > It is a managed load balancer
            > AWS will manage it for you
            > AWS guarantees that it will be working
            > AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
            > AWS provide only a few config knobs
        > It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end
        > It is integrated with many AWS offerings/services
            > EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Amazon ECS
            > AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch
            > Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator
    
    > Health Checks
        > Are crucial for Load Balancers
        > They enable the load balancer ti know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests
        > The health check is done on port and a route (/health is common)
        > If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy
            > the load balancer will skip it

    > Types of load balancers on AWS (4 kinds)
        > Classic Load Balancer
            > (v1 - old generation) - 2009 - CLB
            > HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL (secure TCP)
        > Application Load Balancer
            > (v2 - new generation) - 2016 - ALB
            > HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket
        > Network Load Balancer
            > (v2 - new generation) - 2017 - NLB
            > TCP, TLS (secure TCP), UDP
        > Gateway Load Balancer
            > Operated at layer 3 (Network layer) - IP protocol

    > Overall, it is recommended to use the newer generation load balancers as the provide more features
    > Some load balancers can be setup as internal (private) or external (public) ELBs

    > Load balancer security group
        > a sg that defined the security around the load balancer
            > It should allow access from any where
        > the EC2 instances sq should allow access from the load balancer only
