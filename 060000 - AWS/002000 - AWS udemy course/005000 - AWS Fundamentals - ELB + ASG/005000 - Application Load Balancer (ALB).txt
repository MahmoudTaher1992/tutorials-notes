Application Load Balancer (ALB)
    > Supports
        > HTTP/2
        > WebSocket
        > redirect from HTTP to HTTPs
    > Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across multiple machines
    > Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine (containers)

    > Routing Table
        > Lets you redirect the request to a specific target groups
        > Routing based on path URL
            > example.com/users
            > example.com/posts
        > Routing based on hostname in URL
            > one.example.com
            > other.example.com
        > Routing based on Query String, Headers
            > example.com/users?id=123&order=false

    > Great fit for micro services & container-based application (docker & Amazon ECS)
    > Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS
    > In comparison, We'd need multiple CLB per application

    > Target groups
        > Can be
            > EC2 instances (can be managed by Auto Scaling Group) - HTTP
            > ECS Tasks (managed by ECS itself) - HTTP
            > Lambda functions - HTTP request is translated into a JSON event
            > IP Addresses - must be private IPs

        > ALB can route to multiple target groups
        > Health checks are the target group level
