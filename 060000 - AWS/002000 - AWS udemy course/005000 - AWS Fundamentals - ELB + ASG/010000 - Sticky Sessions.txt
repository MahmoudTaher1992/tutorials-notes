Sticky Sessions
    > It is possible to make the request passed to the same instance 
    > It works in CLB & ALB
    > It is done by adding a cookie to the request
        > Cookies
            > Cookie is an information that a website puts on users browser
            > Cookies store limited info from a browser session on a given website
            > Can be retrieved in the future
            > The server puts some info in the browser (i.e sessionId) to be able to retrieve history of the user activity
    > If the user loses his cookies, the ELB will not remember him and may send him to another instance
    > Enabling stickiness may bring unbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances
