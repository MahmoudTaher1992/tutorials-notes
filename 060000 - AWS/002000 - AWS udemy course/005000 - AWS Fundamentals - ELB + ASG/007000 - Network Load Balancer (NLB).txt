Network Load Balancer (NLB)
    > Layer 4
    > Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances
    > Handle millions of requests per seconds
    > Less latency ~100ms (vs 400ms in ALB)

    > NLP has one static IP per AZ
    > Supports assigning Elastic IP (helpful for whitelisting specific IP)

    > Used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic
    > NOT INCLUDED IN THE AWS FREE TIER

    > Target Groups
        > EC2 Instances
