Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
    > Deploy, scale and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances in AWS
    > Examples
        > Firewalls
        > Intrusion detection and prevention systems
        > Deep packet inspection systems
        > Payload manipulation
    > Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) - IP Packets
    > Combines the following functions
        > 1. Transparent network gateway - single entry/exit for all traffic
        > 2. Distributes traffic to all virtual appliances
    > Uses the GENEVE protocol on 6081

    > How it works
        > The request hits the GWLB
        > Request is distributed on 3rd party security virtual appliances
        > If it passes the appliances the GWLB passes it to the destination

    > Target groups
        > EC2 instances
        > IP addresses - must be private IPs

    > It is very difficult to get Hands on - it will be skipped
