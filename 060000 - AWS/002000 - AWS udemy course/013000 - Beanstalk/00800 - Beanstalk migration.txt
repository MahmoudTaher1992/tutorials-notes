Beanstalk migration
    > Load Balancer
        > you can not upgrade a load balancer within the beanstalk
        > the solution is to create a new environment with the new load balancer's type
        > after creation, deploy the application to it
        > perform a CNAME swap or Route 53 update

    > RDS
        > the database is one of the resources that are critical and needs to be alive all the time, especially the production databases
        > the best approach is to exclude the database from the environment and replace it with a variable (the connection string)
        > to do so
            > create a snapshot from the database
            > protect the database from deletion
            > create a new environment with the connection string instead of the database
            > convert the traffic to the new environment
            > delete the old environment
                > you have to delete the cloudformation stack as it will fail the first time because the database is protected
