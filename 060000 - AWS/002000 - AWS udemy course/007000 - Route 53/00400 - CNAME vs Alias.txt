    > AWS resources expose an AWS host name
        > i.e.
            > aaa.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com

    > CNAME
        > points a hostname to another hostname
        > only for non-root domain
            > example.com is not accepted

    > Alias
        > points a hostname to aws resource
        > works for root domain and non root domain
        > free
        > Native health check
        > is an extension to DNS functionality
        > automatically detects the change in the aws resource's ip address
        > always of type A and AAAA for aws resource ipv4/ipv6
        > you can not set TTL
