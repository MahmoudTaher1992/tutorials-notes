Multi value routing policy
    > routing traffic to multiple resources
    > Route 53 return multiple values/resources
    > can be associated with health checks (so that route 53 returns only the healthy endpoints)
    > up to 8 healthy records are returned for each multi-value query
    > multi-value is not a substitute for having an ELB
