EC2 Instance Roles Demo
    > The aim from this demo is to tell you what IAM Roles do
    > Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH
    > Try listing IAM uses in the AWS account the EC2 instance on
        > You should not provide the instance with your access keys (Remember those keys are not sharable, 
          It for your own use only. An instance is not you). Any body can access the EC2 instance and get your keys.
    > You will end up using IAM roles
        > Create a role with a policy that allows listing iam users
        > Attach this role to the EC2 instance
        > Try listing IAM users from EC2 instance, It should work.
        > Hint: It can take some time for the changes to take place.
