Security Groups
    > Fundamental of network security in AWS
    > They control how traffic is allowed into or out of EC2 instances
    > Only contain allow rules
    > Reference by IP address/ Other security Groups
    > Acts as firewall on EC2 instances
    > They regulate
        > Access to ports
        > Authorized IP ranges 
        > Control of inbound network (From others to EC2 instance)
            > Blocked by default
        > Control of outbound network (From EC@ instance to others)
            > Allowed by default
    > It is better to separate the inbound and outbound in different security groups
    > It is better to separate SSH security group
    > Can be attached to multiple EC2 instances
    > Locked down to region
    > Does live outside the EC2 instance, And it doesn't know anything about it
    > Responses
        > Site keeps waiting forever > Security group issue, It is blocking the request
        > Connection refused > This is an application error, The security group passed the request to the instance
    > Security groups can be referenced by instances
        > You can have an instances that authorize SecurityGroup1 & SecurityGroup2. Any EC2 instance having those will have
          permission to access the instance (Without defining IPs).
