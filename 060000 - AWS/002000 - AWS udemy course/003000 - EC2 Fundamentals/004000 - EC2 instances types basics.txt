EC2 instances types basics
    > There are different type of EC2 instances
    > There is a website the tells you the types listings

    > Naming convention
        > m5.2xlarge
            > m = instance class
            > 2 = generation (improves by time)
            > 2xlarge = size within instance class

    > Instance types
        > General purpose
            > Great for diversity of workloads
                > Web servers
                > Code repositories
            > Balance between
                > Compute
                > Memory
                > Networking

        > Compute optimized
            > Great from compute intensive tasks that require high performance
                > Batch processing workloads
                > Media transcoding
                > High performance web servers
                > High performance computing
                > Scientific modelling
                > Machine learning
                > Gaming servers

        > Memory optimized
            > Fast performance for workloads the process large data sets in memory
                > High performance relational/non-relational databases
                > Distributed web scale cache stores
                > In-memory databases optimized for BI
                > Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

        > Storage optimized
            > Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access 
              to large data sets on local storage
                > High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
                > Relational & NoSQL databases
                > Cache and in-memory databases (i.e Redis)
                > Data warehousing apps
                > Distributed file systems
