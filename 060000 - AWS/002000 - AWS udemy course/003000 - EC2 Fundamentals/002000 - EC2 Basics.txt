EC2 Basics
    > Most popular of AWS offering
    > = Elastic Compute Cloud - Infrastructure as a Service

    > It consists of 
        > Renting virtual machines (EC2)
        > Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
        > Distributing load across machines (ELB)
        > Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

    > Knowing EC2 is fundamental to know how the cloud works

    > EC2 sizing & configuration options
        > Operating System
            > Linux
            > Windows
            > Mac OS
        > CPU - How much compute power & cores
        > RAM - How much random access memory
        > Storage
            > Network attached (EBS | EFS)
            > Hardware (EC2 instance store)
        > Network card
            > Speed of the card
            > Public IP address
        > Firewall rules - security group
        > Bootstrap script - EC2 user data
            > A piece of code that setups the EC2 instance for you
            > Bootstrapping means launching commands when the machine starts
            > It runs only once at the instance first starts
            > Used to automate boot tasks such as:
                > Installing updates
                > Installing software
                > Downloading common files from the internet
                > Anything
            > Runs with root user

    > EC2 instance types
        > Many types that varies in sizing and configuration options
