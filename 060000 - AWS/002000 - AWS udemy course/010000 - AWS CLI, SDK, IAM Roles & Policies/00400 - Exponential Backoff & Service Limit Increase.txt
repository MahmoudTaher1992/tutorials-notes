Exponential Back-off & Service Limit Increase
    > AWS Limits (Quotas)
        > API rate limits
            > there are limits on AWS APIs
            > i.e.
                > DescribeInstances API has a limit of 100 calls per second
                > GetObject on S3 has a limit of 5500 GET request per second per prefix
            > solution
                > intermittent errors => Exponential Back-off
                    > 5xx errors
                    > Exponential Back-off
                        > this is the solution to the API rate limits 
                        > increase the retry period exponentially
                            > if you get the error retry in
                                > 1 sec
                                > 2 sec
                                > 4 sec
                                > 8 sec
                                > 16 sec
                        > by the time you will get the error solved
                        
                > consistent errors => api throttling limit increase

        > Service quotas (Service limits)
            > you can demand to increase the limit
