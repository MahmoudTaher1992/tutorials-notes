    > Optimistic locking
        > update/delete works only if the item version is the same as the one in the request
        > if the version is different, the operation will fail
        > this is to prevent overwriting changes that were made by another process
        > the version is a number that gets incremented on each update and stored as an attribute in the item

        > utilizing in memory cache to speed up read requests
        > does not require changes to the application
        > solves the hot partition problem

            > stores the result of read requests, while DAX stores individual items that can be used later for another request
