Indexes
    > Local secondary index (LSI)
        > Alternative sort key for a table
        > consists of one scalar attribute (String, Number, or Binary)
        > You can have up to 5 LSI per table
        > Must be defined at table creation time
        > attribute projections
            > KEYS_ONLY
                > only the key attributes are projected into the index tables
            > INCLUDE
                > only the specified attributes are projected into the index tables
            > ALL
                > all attributes are projected into the index tables
        > if the writes are throttled on the GSI, the main table is NOT throttled
            > uses the main table RCU/WCU

    > Global secondary index (GSI)
        > An index with a partition key and a sort key that can be different from those on the table
        > Speeds up queries on non-key attributes
        > consists of one scalar attribute (String, Number, or Binary)
        > attribute projections
            > KEYS_ONLY
            > INCLUDE
            > ALL
        > must provision the RCU and WCU for the GSI
        > can be added/modified after the table creation

        > if the writes are throttled on the GSI, the main table is throttled
            > even if the main table has enough RCU/WCU
            > choose it wisely
