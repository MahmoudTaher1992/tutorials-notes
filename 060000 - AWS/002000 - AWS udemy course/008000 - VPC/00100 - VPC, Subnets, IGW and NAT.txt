VPC, Subnets, IGW and NAT
    > VPC
        > Virtual private cloud
        > it is a foundation for AWS services
            > i.e.
                > EC2 instances can not be accessed without an underlying VPC
        > it behaves like a traditional TCP/IP network (Physical Data Center) that can be expanded and scaled as needed
        > a place where the AWS resources are deployed
        > it is regional resource

    > Subnets
        > Building block of VPC
        > allows you to partition your network inside the VPC
        > it is a AZ resource

        > types
            > public subnets
                > a subnet that is accessible from the internet
            > private subnets
                > a subnet that is not accessible from the internet

    > Route tables
        > defines the accessability between 
            > the subnets and each other
            > the subnets and the internet

    > Internet Gateway (IGW)
        > helps VPC to connect with the internet
        > public subnets have a route to the internet gateway

    > NAT Gateway & NAT instances 
        > allow private subnets to access the internet while remaining private
