VPC, Subnets, IGW and NAT
    > VPC
        > Virtual private cloud
        > it is a foundation for AWS services
            > i.e.
                > EC2 instances can not be accessed without an underlying VPC
        > it behaves like a traditional TCP/IP network (Physical Data Center) that can be expanded and scaled as needed
        > a place where the AWS resources are deployed
        > it is regional resource

        > virtual network dedicated to your AWS account, like owning your own private network
        > isolated from other VPCs
        > used to contain AWS resources
        > you have control on everything i.e.
            > IP address range selection
            > subnets creation
            > route tables configurations
            > network gateways configurations

    > Ip address range
        > here you specify a range from which all the instances' IP addresses will be assigned
        > why do you specify it, not AWS?
            > give you control
            > organization and planning
            > security
                > helps you to allow/disallow specific ip ranges
            > make sure no overlap will happen
        > these ip addresses are private
            > they are only used within the VPC itself
            > they are used to communicate between the instances within the VPC
            > public ip addresses are used to communicate from the internet
                > you have to add IGW to your VPC to allow the communication from the internet
                > you also have to setup the routing in the route table
        > divided into subnets

    > Subnets
        > Building block of VPC
        > allows you to partition your network inside the VPC
        > it is a AZ resource

        > types
            > public subnets
                > a subnet that is accessible from the internet
                > have a route into the IGW
                    > normally you have to set it up through the route tables
            > private subnets
                > a subnet that is not accessible from the internet
                > don't have a route to the IGW
                > resources 

        > also known as sub-networks
            > a small network in the VPC
            > improved security and performance

    > Route tables
        > used to determine where the network traffic is directed
        > each subnet must be associated with a route table
            > the table controls the traffic routing for the subnet
        > defines the accessability between 
            > the subnets and each other
            > the subnets and the internet

    > Internet Gateway (IGW)
        > helps VPC to connect with the internet
        > public subnets have a route to the internet gateway

    > NAT Gateway & NAT instances 
        > allow private subnets to access the internet while remaining private

    > Connecting 2 VPCs together
        > achieved using a feature called VPC peering
        > done by
            > requesting and accepting a VPC peering connection
            > updating the route tables
        > does not support transitive peering relationships
            > i.e. if A is peered with B and B is peered with C, A and C are not peered
