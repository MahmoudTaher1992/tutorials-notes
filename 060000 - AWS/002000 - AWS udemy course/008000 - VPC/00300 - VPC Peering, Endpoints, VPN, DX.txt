    > VPC Peering
        > if you want to connect two vpcs together you should use VPC peering
        > Makes them behave as if they are one VPC
        > Must not have an overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
        > VPC Peering is not transitive
            > if you connect VPC1 & VPC2 
            > then you connect VPC2 & VPC3
            > VPC1 & VPC3 will not be able to connect to each other, you have to add VPC1 & VPC3 connection

    > VPC endpoints
        > allow you to connect to AWS services using the private network instead of the internet
        > pros
            > higher speed
            > higher security
        
        > types
            > VPC endpoint gateway
                > S3
                > DynamoDB
            > VPC endpoint interface
                > rest of AWS services

    > VPN, DX
        > to connect AWS VPN to an on premises data center
            > two ways
                > site to site VPN
                    > connect on premises VPN to AWS
                    > the connection is automatically encrypted
                    > goes over the public internet

                > Direct connect (DX)
                    > establish a physical connection between on premises and AWS
                    > the connection is private, fast and secure
                    > goes over private network
                    > takes at least a month to establish
