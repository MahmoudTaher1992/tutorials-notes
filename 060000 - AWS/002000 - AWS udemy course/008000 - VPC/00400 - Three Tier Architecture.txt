            > public subnet
            > private subnet
            > data subnet

        > public subnet
            > put the ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) in it

        > private subnet
            > put EC2 instances in it
            > you can put it in ASG (Auto scaling group)

        > data subnet
            > put the database anf the cache services in it

        > all the services should be private and allow the private connection between them
        > the only public component will be the ELB
