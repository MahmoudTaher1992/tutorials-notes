Lambda Concurrency
    > Concurrency and Throttling
        > Concurrency limit = 1000 concurrent executions
        > you can set a reserved concurrency limit
            > if the concurrency exceeded the limit a throttle error will be thrown
                > sync invocations will have the error as the return value
                > async invocations will also have the error but it will retry until it succeeds or returned to DLQ
                    > it may return the event to it's queue
        > if you need a higher limit open a support ticket

    > Cold start
        > when lambda is initialized
            > the code is loaded
            > the code outside the handler will run
        > if the initialization time is long, first request served by new instances will have a higher latency than the others

        > Provisioned concurrency
            > the solution for the cold start

            > the number of pre-initialized environments you want to allocate to your function
                > those environments are prepared to respond immediately to incoming requests
