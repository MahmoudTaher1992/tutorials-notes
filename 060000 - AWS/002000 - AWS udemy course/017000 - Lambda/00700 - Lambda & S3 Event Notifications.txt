Lambda & S3 Event Notifications
    > you can setup S3 to start a lambda function on events
        > events
            > object created
            > object removed
            > object restore
            > replication

        > filtering
            > you can filter by the extension or any part in the name
            > the filetype
            > ...

    > use case
        > generate thumbnails from a videos

    > S3 typically deliver events in seconds but sometimes it can take minutes

    > if two writes happened to the same non-versioned object in the same time, it is possible that only one event will be fired
        > enabling versioning will overcome this problem
