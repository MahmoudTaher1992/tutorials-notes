Lambda Monitoring & X-Ray Tracing
    > Logging and Monitoring
        > CloudWatch Logs
            > AWS lambda execution logs are stored in AWS CloudWatch Logs
            > make sure that AWS lambda has an execution role that authorizes the write to CloudWatch

        > CloudWatch metrics
            > all lambda metrics are displayed in CloudWatch metrics
            > invocations, durations, concurrent executions
            > error count, throttles, success rates
            > async delivery failures
            > iterator age 
                > Kinesis
                > DynamoDB streams

    > Lambda tracing with X-Ray
        > You have to enable it in lambda configuration
        > runs the X-Ray daemon for you
        > use AWS X-RAY SDK in the code
        > ensure that the lambda function has the right IAM role
