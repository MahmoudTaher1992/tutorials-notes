Asynchronous Invocations
    > Lambda functions can be invocated in async from different services
        > i.e.
            > S3
            > SNS
            > CloudWatch events
            > ...
    
    > it helps speed up the processing time
        > i.e.
            > processing 1000 files in sync
            > ...

    > the events are placed in event queue
    > the lambda function picks the events from the event queue
    > if the invocation fails it will retry 2 times
        > one after 1 minute and the 2nd after 2 minutes
        > you will see a duplicated logs in case of retries
        > you can defined a DLQ (dead-letter queue) SNS or SQS for failed processing
