        > workflow
            > a process to be done
            > contains multiple jobs
            > written in YAML file
            > triggers
                > manually
                > on schedule
                > on event occurrence
                > on an api call
            > defined in the .github/workflows directory
            > you can have multiple workflows for each repository
            > workflows can be referenced within each other

        > triggers
            > activity in the repo that triggers the execution of a workflow
            > i.e.
                > pull request created
                > issue created
                > pull request merged

        > job
            > a building unit of the workflow
            > contains multiple steps
            > it runs on  a VM called runners
            > you can control the dependencies of the jobs in the workflow

        > runner
            > a VM used to run a job
            > one runner for each job
            > can run in parallel or sequential
