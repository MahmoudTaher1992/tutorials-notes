    > platform designed for automating the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers

        > Automated Deployment, Rollbacks and Rollouts
            > automatically deploying changes to the application
            > by
                > Declarative Configuration
                    > describes the desired state of the deployed application in a YAML file or JSON file
                > Rolling updates
                    > updating the application without downtime
                    > by
                        > creating a new instance of the application
                        > and then destroying the old instance
                > Automated Rollbacks
                    > If something goes wrong during an update, Kubernetes can automatically roll back to a previous stable version.
        > Automated scaling
            > automatically scaling the application based on the load
            > by
                > Horizontal Scaling
                    > adding more pods
                > Vertical Scaling
                    > increasing the resources of the pod
                > Cluster Scaling
                    > adding more worker nodes
        > Load balancing
        > Self-Healing
        > Storage Orchestration
        > Secret and Configuration Management
        > portability
            > the worker node can work on any cloud provider or system (windows, linux, ...)
