Web API
    > This is the interface of the browser that enables you to do additional stuff such as
        > Client storage management
        > Form Data
        > Drag-and-Drop API
        > Geolocation API
        > Notification API
        > Canvas API
        > History API
        > Network Requests
        > Async tasks
            > setTimeout
            > setInterval
            > Javascript is a single-threaded language
                > it runs only one task at a moment
                > to overcome this issue
                    > WebApi, Callback queue & event-loop work together to implement multi-threaded operations
