V8 JavaScript Engine
    > is an open source JavaScript and WebAssembly engine that compiles JavaScript to optimized machine code before execution
    > developed for Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers to improve the performance of JavaScript execution
    > The engine was initially designed solely for execution by web browsers, but the latest versions also execute JS code 
      outside the browser, enabling server-side scripting.
    > To achieve faster JavaScript execution speeds, V8 translates JS code to more efficient machine code instead of using an interpreter
    > How it works
        > The engine compiles and executes the JS code
        > The engine handles the call stack
        > The engine manages the memory heap
        > The engine handles the garbage collection
        > The engine provides all the data types, objects and functions
        > The engine also provides the event loop (sometimes implemented by the browser as well)
