Scope
    > Scope means area
        > area where variables are defined, visible and accessible

    > refers to the accessability or visibility of variables

    > manages variables accessability

    Its importance
        ownership of variables
        avoid name collision

    Nested scopes
        if you create a function nested inside another function, the child function has an inner scope that is 
            wrapped
        inside the outer scope > so it has access to the variables declared in the outer scope

    Types
        Global Scope
            variables and functions can be accessed from any where in the code

        Function Scope
            All variables inside the function can be accessed inside the function not from outside

        Block Scope
            > i.e
                > if 
                > for
                > while
                
            All variables inside the block can be accessed inside the function not from outside

            let and const work only in this Scope
