Block scope
    > used to group one or more statements together

    > bounded by "curly brackets" { }

    > You can find blocks
        > standalone code block
            > i.e.
                {
                    // code goes here
                }
        > if
        > for
        > while
        > switch
        > functions
            > for this case it is called "function scope"
            > There is no difference between normal function, arrow function & anonymous function
            > They all have the same function scope
            > function code block will create a scope for let, const & var

    > A code block in javascript defines a scope for variables declared using 'let' | 'const'

    > A code block doesn't create a scope for var variables (but a function body does)
