    > used to group one or more statements together
    > bounded by "curly brackets" { }
    > You can find blocks
        > if
        > for
        > while
        > switch
        > functions
            > for this case it is called "function scope"
            > There is no difference between normal function, arrow function & anonymous function
            > They all have the same function scope
            > let, const, var will stick with the function scope
