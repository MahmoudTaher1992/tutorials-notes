Data types
    Two main categories of data types (Primitive and Non-Primitive)
        Primitive
            Data types that refer to a single value
            Not mutable
            Pass by value
                let a = 10;
                let b = a;
                b references to another address in the memory, changing a doesn't affect by
            i.e.
                Number
                string
                boolean
                bigint
                null
                undefined
                symbol    

        Non-Primitive
            Refers to objects > multiple values
            mutable
            Pass by reference
                let a = { name: "taher" };
                let b = a;
                b.name = "Omar"
                console.log(a.name) // "Omar"
                b references to same address in the memory, changing it affects the original variable
