JavaScript Constants
    The const keyword was also introduced in the ES6(ES2015) version to create constants.
        const x = 5;

    Once a constant is initialized, we cannot change its value.
        const x = 5;
        x = 10;  // Error! constant cannot be changed.
        console.log(x)

    Simply, a constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.

    Also, you cannot declare a constant without initializing it.
        const x;  // Error! Missing initializer in const declaration.
        x = 5;
        console.log(x)

    Note
        If you are sure that the value of a variable won't change throughout the program, it's recommended to use const. 
        However, there are a few browsers that do not support const
