Redux architecture
    > Store
        > Single source of truth to the global state
        > accessible for every part in the app

    > Reducer
        > A pure function that gets the store and the action and returns new state
        > the only way to update the state in the store

    > Actions
        > Plain js objects that is used to change the state by going to reducers
