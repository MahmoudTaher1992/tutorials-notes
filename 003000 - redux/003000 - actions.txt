Actions
    > the only way to interact w. the Store
    > carry info from app to store (through payload property or any other property)
    > plain js object
    > have a type to indicate the action being performed
    > the type property is string

    > i.e.
        let action = {
            type: "ADD_ITEM_TO_CART",
            payload: {
                itemId: 156,
                itemDesc: "GALAXY S9+"
            }
        }

    > Action creators
        > Normal functions that help you create the action
        > Helps in making all the code in one place > less bugs

        > i.e.
            function addItemToCart() {
                return {
                    type: "ADD_ITEM_TO_CART",
                    payload: {
                        itemId: 156,
                        itemDesc: "GALAXY S9+"
                    }
                }
            }
