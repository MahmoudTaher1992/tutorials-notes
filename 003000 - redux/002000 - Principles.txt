Principles
    1st
        the state is in one object in a single Store
    
    2nd
        the only way to change the state is through dispatching an action
            you are not allowed to directly edit the state

    3rd
        Pure reducers are the way to change the state
            lies under the rules of pure functions

            Reducer syntax
                (prevState, action) => newState
