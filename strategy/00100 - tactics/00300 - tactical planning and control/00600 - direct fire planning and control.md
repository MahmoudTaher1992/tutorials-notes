### Employment of Direct Fires

Shooting at targets you can see directly should be effective, lethal (deadly), and safe

*   **Field of Fire**
    *   Effective shooting area
*   **Fire Control Measures**
    *   Rules and tools a leader uses to tell their soldiers when, where, and how to shoot
    *   To make sure everyone focuses their firepower on the most important targets, prevents friendly fire (fratricide), and uses ammunition efficiently.
    *   **Examples of Measures**:
        *   **Sector of Fire**: Each solider has his sector to shoot at
        *   **Trigger**: Shoot after the vehicle cross the bridge
        *   **Target Reference Point (TRP)**: 20 meter right to the building




### Principles for Direct Fire Planning and Control

*   **1. Destroy the Greatest Threat First**
    *   Always shoot at the enemy who can do you the most harm immediately.
*   **2. Massed fire**
    *   Don't spread your fire out randomly. Focus firepower on a critical enemy point to achieve a decisive (final) result
*   **3. Employ the Best Weapon for the Specific Target**
    *   Use the right tool for the right job. This saves ammunition and is more effective.
*   **4. Avoid Target Overkill**
    *   Use just enough firepower to destroy a target, and no more. Wasting ammunition on one target means you have less for the next one.
*   **5. Minimize Exposure**
    *   Don't make yourself an easy target. Only expose yourself to enemy fire for the absolute minimum time required to be effective.
*   **6. Plan and Implement Control Measures**
    *   Before the battle, draw the lines and set the rules (fire control measures) to prevent chaos and friendly fire
*   **7. Plan for Limited-Visibility Conditions**
    *   The dark, fog, or smoke shouldn't stop you. Prepare for fighting when you can't see well
*   **8. Plan for Degraded Capabilities**
    *   Things will go wrong. Weapons will break, people will get hurt. Have a backup plan
