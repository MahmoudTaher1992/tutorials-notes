# Combat Operations: Daylight vs. Limited-Visibility

## I. Daylight Operations
*   **Definition**: operations conducted during daytime
*   **Advantages**:
    *   **Equipment Use**: More equipments can be used
    *   **Control of Maneuver**: Easy troops direction and coordination, because they see each other.
    *   **Stress Reduction**: A lot more easier for soldiers to operate in the daylight
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   **Enemy Effectiveness**: Enemy is more efficient
    *   **Loss of Technical Overmatch**: You lose the advantage of your high tech equipments.

## II. Limited-Visibility Operations
*   **Definition**: operations conducted under reduced visibility conditions, such as at night, fog, ...
*   **Categories of Limited-Visibility Conditions**:
    *   **Technology-Overcomable**: night => night vision googles
    *   **Technology-Unovercomable**: dust, smoke, heavy rain, snow, fog, thick vegetation, ...
*   **General Characteristics**:
    *   **Deliberate Nature**:
        *   require more careful planning and slower execution compared to daylight operations
        *   due to the increased challenges
        *   Imagine trying to set up a complex tent in the dark !!
    *   **Exceptions**: 
        *   follow-up to a daylight attack
        *   exploitation (taking advantage of a shattered enemy)
        *   pursuit (chasing a retreating enemy)
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   **Control Issues**:
        *   It's much harder to manage and direct your units, when you can't see them clearly or their targets
        *   i.e.
            *   A commander might struggle to ensure all his platoons are advancing in the correct direction, if radio communication is not there, and visual signs are absent
    *   **Targeting Difficulties**: Identifying and accurately hitting enemy targets becomes challenging
    *   **Navigation and Movement**: 
        *   Moving without being detected is harder
        *   soldiers can easily get lost or stumble into unexpected enemy positions
        *   i.e.
            *   Strategy
                *   if the enemy is succeeding in tech, you can face him with ambushes
    *   **Casualty Management**: Locating, providing first aid to, and evacuating injured soldiers is significantly more difficult
    *   **Obstacle Handling**: 
        *   Finding, going around, or breaking through enemy obstacles is a major challenge. 
        *   Units might waste critical time trying to find a safe path through a wired fence they can barely see.
*   **Advantages (When Trained & Equipped)**:
    *   **Superiority over Unprepared Enemy**
    *   **Concealment**: 
        *   Darkness or bad weather can hide the movement and positions of large military forces.
    *   **Psychological Impact**: 
        *   Attackers can create more shock, confusion, and isolation among the enemy
    *   **Air Support**: 
        *   Airplanes and helicopters can operate more easily because enemy air defenders relying on optical sights struggle to acquire targets at night.
    *   **Increased Surprise**: 
        *   Military deception tactics (like using fake lights or noise to trick the enemy) become more effective. 
        *   A unit might use decoy vehicle lights to make the enemy think they are attacking from one direction, while the real attack comes from another unseen flank.
*   **Organization and Planning Considerations**:
    *   **Noise and Light Discipline**: minimize noise and light to avoid detection
    *   **Illumination**:
        *   **Non-illuminated attacks** offer the highest chance of achieving surprise
        *   However, illumination to be available for immediate use in emergencies
        *   The decision of using illumination is critical and must be taken carefully
    *   **Planning Emphasis (Key Points)**:
        *   **Simplicity**: to avoid confusion in a low-visibility environment
        *   **Reconnaissance**: The more you know, the higher the success chances
        *   **Control Measures**: Use clear roads/building/features, don't confuse the team
        *   **Rehearsals**: Conduct them in the daylight initially, and in the night later
*   **Assumption of Enemy Capabilities**:
    *   **Assume Equality**: This prevents complacency (self satisfaction)
    *   **Close Movement**: soldiers or vehicles can keep track of each other more easily and react faster
