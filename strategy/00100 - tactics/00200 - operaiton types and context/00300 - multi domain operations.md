# Multi Domain operations

* MDO is the idea that to defeat a powerful enemy, the army must attack in all domains at the same time
    * Land, Air, Sea, Space and Cyberspace
    * reduce the effectiveness of the enemy by making him confused and paralyzed
* MDO is a Team Sport
    * no military division can do it alone !!
* A Two-Way Street of Capabilities
    * each member in the joint team gives (it's capabilities) the team and gets (other's capabilities) from it
* ALL Army Operations are Multidomain
    * Army can not function without satellites (space domain)
    * Army can not function in some operations without air support (Air domain)
    * ...
* Scale matters
    * Number matters
        * if you have large forces, you can attack, defend in the same time
        * if you don't, you can do one thing at a time.
