### Post-Combat Actions

Critical actions a unit takes after a fight to maintain its strength and prepare for the next mission

*   **Consolidate**
    *   To organize and strengthen a position you just captured so you can defend it from an enemy counter-attack.
    *   Winning a piece of ground is only half the battle; now you have to keep it. 
    *   Consolidation is the process of turning your offense into a defense.
    *   **i.e.**
        *   **Consolidation may include:**
            1.  **Security**: securing the winned ground
            2.  Eliminate Resistance
            3.  **Reposition**: Moving machine guns to the best positions
            4.  **Adjust Fires**: Calling in their new position to artillery so they can get fire support if attacked.
            5.  **Resupply**: Distributing water, food and ammunition.
*   **Reconstitution**
    *   The process of rebuilding a unit's combat power after it has taken heavy losses.
    *   This is about restoring a unit's ability to fight effectively. 
    *   **Reorganization (The Quick Fix)**
        *   Using the resources you still have *within the unit* to patch it up and keep it in the fight.
        *   **i.e.**
            *   If you have 2 tanks, one is destroyed and the other has 2 member killed, merge them in one tank.
    *   **Regeneration (The Full Rebuild)**
        *   Pulling a unit completely out of the fight and sending it to a rear area to be rebuilt with large-scale replacements of people, equipment, and supplies.
