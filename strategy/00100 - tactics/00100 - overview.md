# Tactics overview




## Definitions


### Strategy

* The big why and what
* No detailed commands
* You have to divide it into small chunks, to be executed (here comes the tactics)

### Operation

* A series of tactical actions with a common purpose
* a small step in achieving the strategy goal
* i.e.
    * If you want to win a football season, an operation is winning a single match
    * If you want to defeat enemy (X), you have to take city (Y) which acts as a supply line for him
        * the strategy is defeat enemy
        * the operation is take city

### Tactics

* Tactics are the employment, ordered arrangement and directed actions of forces in relation to each other.
* i.e.
    * If you want to take city Y (operation), 
        * You can't just send everyone running at the city, You need a plan made of smaller tactical actions
        * here are the tactics
            * Tactic 1: Seize the Bridge
            * Tactic 2: Block Reinforcements
            * Tactic 3: Main Assault

### Maneuver

* Movement
    * act of displacing forces from point A to point B
    * it is done as a preparation to create the right conditions to maneuver
* Maneuver
    * movement in conjunction with fires
    * to gain and exploit (derive benefit from) positions of relative advantage to accomplish the mission.
    * isn't just "moving."
        * It's moving smartly 
        * to get an advantage 
        * or putting the enemy in a worse position
    * you almost always do it with the help of shooting ("fires").
* i.e.
    * in Seize the Bridge Tactic
        * you found a machine gun bunker defending the entrance
            * you can not just order the soldiers to move to it, that would be a disaster.
            * instead you put the bunker under a machine gun from your side, to reduce or stop their ability of firing with accuracy
            * another squad should move while the first one is shooting, to a ditch on the side of the bunker where the bunker can not shoot at
            * once they are there, they can eliminate the bunker with grenades

### Warfighting Functions Integration and Synchronization

* Every commander should use the following tools
    * Command and Control (C2)
        * The commander's brain and voice
        * the process of making decisions
        * Communicating orders

    * Movement and Maneuver
        * The unit's legs and fists.
    
    * Intelligence
        * The unit's eyes and ears
        * i.e.
            * spies
            * drones
            * scouts
            * ...

    * Fires
        * The unit's long-range punch
        * i.e.
            * artillery cannons
            * mortars
            * attack aircraft
            * ...

    * Sustainment
        * The unit's lifeblood
        * logistical and medical support

    * Protection
        * The unit's shield
        * everything that keeps your soldiers safe
        * i.e.
            * camouflage
            * building defensive trenches
            * air defense systems
            * ...

* Integration
    * usage of all possible tool/resources you have
    * i.e.
        * You don't plan an attack without thinking how you will get more ammo
    
* Synchronization 
    * each tool/resources should do the right action in the right time in the right place (in time, space, and purpose)

* Understanding the Operational Environment
    * you cannot make a good plan in a vacuum
        * it is a risky plan that doesn't respect the variables

### Operation types

* Offensive
    * you are the attacker, you win by force
    * you want to defeat the enemy and take something from them
        * i.e.
            * territory
            * resources
            * ...
* Defensive
    * You are holding your ground. The enemy is attacking you
    * repel the enemy, protect something, buy time
* Stability
    * create a safe and secure environment
    * establish basic services
    * Create a long-term, stable peace
* Enabling
    * special operations
    * enables you to do offensive or defensive actions
    * create the conditions needed for other operations to succeed


# The Operational Environment

* everything that can affect your mission, from the weather to the enemy's mood to the type of dirt on the ground
* OE domains
    * land
    * air
    * sea
    * space
        * where satellites operate
    * cyberspace
* Dimensions
    * physical
        * anything you can see and measure
    * human
        * every thing about people
        * Commanders who ignore this dimension often lose
        * i.e.
            * morale, training level, culture, religion, relationships, fear, and belief
    * information

* Commander must
    * look beyond their own troops and their enemy in front of them, they must consider everything
        * This enables the commander to see problems, before they become disasters
    * must plan to deal with potential outcomes
        * i.e.
            * if you think that the enemy might surrender, then you have to prepare prisons
    * understand the results of various actions
        * Friendly Actions
            * if the attack succeeded so quickly, we push without a pause, this might cause supply lines stretch, we might not be able to defend against counter-attacks 
        * Enemy Actions
            * if the enemy decided to fight till the end, the operation might take weeks with lots of casualties
        * Adversary Actions
            * a non direct enemy moved his army near the boarders of the city
        * Neutral Actions
            * a red cross aid is scheduled at the day of the operation in the roads that we want to use, we should choose another time/roads


# OPERATIONAL VARIABLES

* Generic
* PMESII-PT
    * Political
        * Who has the power and authority?
        * who is officially in charge ?
        * who is unofficially in charge ? (like a tribal leader or powerful family)
        * What are their goals ?

            * formal (banks, factories) or informal (black markets, bartering)
            * major industries
            * Who controls the wealth
            * levels of unemployment
        * i.e.
            * secure the food processing plant, to keep the people with you
            * take over the oil refinery, to cut the cash from the insurgents

    * Social
        * How do the people live and interact with each other?

            * if you name the operation something in conflict with their values, they might turn on you

    * Information
        * How do people get their information and what do they believe?
        * How to get information about every thing ?

    * Infrastructure

    * Physical Environment
        * What is the land and weather like?

    * Time
        * How does the timing of events, culture, and our own operations affect the situation?
        * i.e.
            * if the enemy is new, then he might not have all info about the defenses yet, this is an advantage

* Commanders must constantly refine and update their understanding of the operational variables


# Mission Variables

* specific

* METT-TC
    * Mission
        * What have I been ordered to do
    * Enemy
        * capabilities
        * number
        * guns
    * Terrain (and Weather)
    * Troops available
        * your own forces
    * Time available
    * Civil considerations
        * Are there civilians nearby?
        * how will my mission affect them?
        * How will civilians affect my mission

* Information is a lens that must be used to analyze it's effect of METT-TC
    * Mission + I
        * is there a video on the social media that shows our staging area, it shows we are preparing for something ?
    * Enemy + I
        * Is our radio un encrypted, Can the enemy hack us ? Can we hack them ?
        * Are they using emails that we can hack ?
    * Terrain + I
        * Are there a web cam that shows the location life 
    * Troops + I
        * Are the soldiers posting images on facebook with the equipments shown ?
    * Civil + I
        * Are the civilians posting images/videos for the attack ?

# The big picture

* every tactic is linked ot an operation, each operation is linked to the strategic objectives. (nothing is isolated)
    * tactics is nested within large military campaign
* working in isolation is useless and can cause the waste of resources
* military operations are joint and multinational in nature
    * joint means multiple branches of the same army work together on the same operation
    * multinational means multiple armies for multiple countries may work together on the same operation
* understanding the big picture converts the leaders from order-takers to problem solver

# Joint operations

* Joint operations 
    * operations where multiple forces are working together on the same mission
* Unified action
    * joint forces synchronizes its actions with all the other players on the "team."
* Unity of Effort
    * getting everyone rowing in the same direction, to achieve the goal
* strategic roles
    * Shape Operational Environments
        * preventative medicine
        * shape the operational environment, to prevent the war from happening in the first place
    * Counter Aggression on Land During Crisis
        * de-escalate the crisis and deter (prevent from happening) a larger conflict.
    * Prevail in Large-Scale Ground Combat
        * warfighting
        * Deterrence has failed, and war has begun
        * To win the war
    * Consolidate Gains
        * turn military victory into a stable, long-term political success


# Multi Domain operations

* MDO is the idea that to defeat a powerful enemy, the army must attack in all domains at the same time
    * Land, Air, Sea, Space and Cyberspace
    * reduce the effectiveness of the enemy by making him confused and paralyzed
* MDO is a Team Sport
    * no military division can do it alone !!
* A Two-Way Street of Capabilities
    * each member in the joint team gives (it's capabilities) the team and gets (other's capabilities) from it
* ALL Army Operations are Multidomain
    * Army can not function without satellites (space domain)
    * Army can not function in some operations without air support (Air domain)
    * ...
* Scale matters
    * Number matters
        * if you have large forces, you can attack, defend in the same time
        * if you don't, you can do one thing at a time.

# General Considerations for Tactics

* Tactics are methods used to win a battle
    * it is not about using more soldiers or bigger guns
    * it is about using what you have in the smartest way possible

* Tactics plan composition
    * Any tactical plan can be broken down into 3 main activities
        * employment
            * using all your tools together at the right time
            * sparing tools that can be used is a bad tactic
        * Arrangement
            * place your pieces at the best places
            * i.e.
                * hit the enemy where it is weak
        * Directed Actions
            * giving clear orders
            * each unit should know
                * what its specific job
                * why it's important for the overall plan

* The Warfighting Functions (The commander's toolbox)
    * they must be used together to achieve the goal
    * functions
        * Command and Control (brian)
        * Movement and Maneuver (force on ground)
        * Intelligence
        * Fires
        * Sustainment
        * Protection

* Combat power
    * the total fighting ability a unit can bring into a battle
    * it is not about the weapons only
    * you have to generate enough combat power to defeat the enemy
    * combat power ingredients
        * Leadership
            * good leaders is a power to the army
            * search for a strong leader
        * Firepower
        * Information
        * Mobility
            * the ability to move quickly
        * Survivability
            * The ability to take a hit and keep fighting.

# Command and Control (C2) Warfighting Function

* it is The Brain and Nervous System of the military operation
    * it makes the other warfighting functions work together smoothly and effectively
* C2 Goal
    * use all parts effectively
    * synchronized them
    * make them all focused on the same goal 
* C2 result
    * derive the highest combat power
* Commanders role
    * state the mission (what to be done)
    * state the intent (why and what a successful outcome should be)
* Sub commanders' role
    * translate the vision into detailed plans and orders
    * make sure everyone has the right resources
* Communication Challenges
    * clear communications, can be intercepted by the enemy
    * try to make the communications as low as possible
    * enemy can locate you and target you because of communication exposure
    * units need clear pre practiced SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) for how to operate when communications are difficult, ensuring they can still achieve their mission with minimal guidance

# Hasty and Deliberate Operations

* Hasty
    * a surprise
    * You see an opportunity
    * You want to take advantage
    * high risk
    * minimal time for planning
    * Speed is the key advantage

* Deliberate
    * Goal
        * Achieve a complex objective
    * Planning
        * Slow and detailed
    * Perfection and coordination are more important
    * Lower risk during the action

# Tactical Framework

* four-step recipe for planning and executing almost any military operation
* works with
    * attacking
    * defending
* breaks down a complex operation into 4 logical phases
* phases
    * Find
        * you can not fight what you can not find
        * locate the enemy
        * use what ever tools you have to pinpoint the enemy
        * you have also to know every thing possible about them
    * Fix
        * you have to fix your enemy, pin them down
        * you don't want them running away, maybe moving to a better position
        * fixing them will allow you to set them up for the main blow
    * Finish
        * you apply your overwhelming combat power to break the enemy and finish the mission
    * Follow Through
        * Winning the fight is not the end !!
        * hunt down any remaining enemy fighters
        * reorganize your troops
        * treat the wounded
        * prepare for the next mission

# Battle Drill

* It is a set of simple, practiced steps to respond to a common battlefield event
    * it requires lots of drills to train the troops
* Allows soldiers to react correctly and instantly turning a chaotic moment into a controlled response
    * in the chaos of combat, there will be no time to think and plan
    * Speed is life
* The trigger is called a cue
    * i.e.
        * enemy fire
        * a leader's especial command
* Goal
    * take immediate, effective actions to keep the soldiers alive
    * regain advantage over the enemy



# Battle handover

* a formal transfer of an active gunfight from one unit to another
* used tom maintain momentum of the combat power
    * done by bringing fresh units and allowing tired units to leave
* Battle Handover Line
    * a specific line drawn on the map
    * when a fresh unit reaches it, the responsibility of the gunfight is transferred from the old unit to the new one
* types
    * Passage of Lines
        * A fresh unit moves through a tired unit to continue an attack
    * Relief in Place
        * A fresh unit comes in to replace a tired unit in a defensive position
    * Breakout of an Encirclement
        * A rescue force breaks through to a trapped unit



# Control Measures

* it is like instruction manual in the battlefield
* are rules that help in
    * preventing chaos in the battlefield
    * action coordination
    * prevent friendly fire
    * give freedom/restriction  where possible

* types
    * permission
        * Permissive Measures
            * Green Lights
            * i.e.
                * Behind a phase line, artillery can shoot freely
        * Restrictive Measures
            * Red Lights
            * i.e.
                * Don't pass the boundary line, otherwise you will be considered an enemy
    * views
        * graphical symbols on maps
            * digital
                * maps on screens
                * updatable
            * analog
                * printed map in pockets
                * can not be hacked
        * rules in leaders mind



# Terrain Management

* the art of assigning specific pieces of ground to specific units
    * to keep things organized and prevent friendly fire
* assignment ways
    * Area of operations
        * a complete area given to a unit 
        * it is responsible for everything inside it
        * lots of power, lots of responsibilities
    * Zone
        * used in offense
        * has a starting line, left and right boundaries, no end line
    * sector
        * used in defense
        * a part of a terrain where a commander is responsible for it's defense
        * a coordination must happen between the sectors to close the gap between them

# Forms of contact

* contact
    * any interaction with another force
    * advantage
        * the best for is one way contact, where you are in contact with the enemy and he is out of contact with you
    * the most effective units use multiple forms of contact with the enemy to overwhelm him
    * types
        * the enemy and us are in contact
        * we are in contact, the enemy is not
        * the enemy is in contact, we are not
            * you should always suspect this

* forms of contact
    * visual
        * you saw the enemy
    * Electromagnetic
        * you saw him on the radio
    * Indirect
        * artillery is firing at him

        * the enemy shot us with a chemical weapon
    * Influence
        * we have posted a video on social media, we are not going to go after the soldiers who leave their weapons
    * Non-hostile
        * we saw enemies' ambulance moving wounded

* Actions on contact
    * it is a process, not a drill
        * you have to follow the steps

    * steps
        * React
            * take cover
            * return fire to suppress the enemy
        * Develop the Situation
            * understand the situation, your advantages and risks
        * Choose action
            * handle the enemy, avoid, retreat
        * Execute the action and report

# Tactical Mission Tasks

* ensures everyone is speaking the same language
* very specific, standardized verb that tells a military unit exactly what action to perform
* The military has a whole dictionary of these tasks (each one has a precise meaning)
* i.e.
    * Block
        * Stop an enemy from moving through a certain area
    * Seize
        * Clear a location of the enemy and physically occupy it
    * Destroy
        * Physically render an enemy force combat-ineffective. This is a very high standard.
    * Suppress
        * Use fire to prevent the enemy from firing back effectively
        * You're keeping their heads down so another unit can move
    * Fix
        * Pin an enemy in place with fire and/or obstacles so they cannot move from their location

# Multinational Operations

* when the military forces from two or more different countries team up to achieve a common goal
    * i.e.
        * part of an official alliance
        * temporary coalition formed for a specific mission

* Opportunities
    * International Legitimacy
        * you will be accepted by the world
    * Different Authorities & Capabilities
        * Every country has it's special military power
        * combining them gives the commander more options to form a stronger combat power

* Challenges
    * communication issues
        * due to language differences
    * National caveats (Warnings)
        * every country has it's own laws and restrictions
        * this can limit the limits of the commander
            * i.e.
                * germans don't permit offensive attacks
                * US permits it
    * Interoperability concerns
        * the ability of different forces to work effectively with each other 
            * i.e.
                * Does french air fighters transmit radio waves that can be heared by us tanks ?

* Solutions to the challenges
    * Liaison Officers
        * officers that facilitates the communication between multinational units
            * they should now military stuff, to be able to conduct and translate the communications
    * Simple Orders
    * Train Together



# Local Security

* A security system for a military unit in the field
* formation of protective bubble 
    * location
        * around the military unit
    * goal

            * a surprise attack
                * incredibly dangerous
        * maintaining the initiative
            * if you lost the initiative, you will no longer be in control
            * ensures that you see the enemy first, allowing you to keep control of the situation
    * how
        * small activities near the unit
            * Avoiding enemy detection
                * If they can't see you, they can't attack you.
            * actively looking for the enemy around you

* Methods
    * Active Measures (Proactively Looking for Danger)
        * Observation Posts
            * Placing a few soldiers in a hidden spot with a good view
                * Their only job is to watch for enemy movement and report back
            * static observer
            * cons
                * Dead Ground
                * Passive

                * Close and detailed information
                * drawing force (drawing the enemy into the trap)
        * Establishing Levels of Alert / SOPs
            * i.e.
                * low alert
                    * 25% of the unit is awake
                * high alert
                    * 50%-100% of the unit is awake

    * Passive Measures (making yourself hard to find)
        * Camouflage
        * Movement Control
            * minimize the signatures created by your movement
                * to prevent the enemy from detecting you
        * Noise and Light Discipline
        * Electromagnetic Protection
            * detection can come waves coming out of your location
        * Use of 
            * Sensors
            * Night Vision
            * Sights


# Reserves

* definition
    * a group of troops a commander holds back from the initial fighting of the battle

* importance
    * Flexibility and Adaptability
        * gives the commander ability to respond to unexpected situations
    * Exploiting Success
        * take advantage of a weak spot in the right time
            * in the battle, some of the forces can find this weak spot, if a reserve was not there we lose this opportunity
    * Preventing Failure
        * if another force is about to fail, they can jump in and prevent the failure
    * Regaining Initiative
    
* Commanders Decisions
    * When to commit
        * reserve utilization is one of the hardest decisions
        * it should be taken
            * in the best time
            * the best place
            * the best circumstances

    * Not for routine tasks
        * routine tasks are trivial and reserves are made for critical missions
    * No Support Assets in Reserve
        * you should not put artillery in reserve

* Re-forming a Reserve
    * if the reserve is used, units should create a new Reserve
        * a commander can assign the reserve role for another unit
    * units must never rely on the commander sending them the reserve
        * they should deal with the situation
        * you plans should always be like this
            * depend on what you have
            * not on what others have

* Where to place
    * Generally to the Rear
        * protection
        * ability to attack
    * Beyond Direct Fire Range
        * so the enemy can not shoot them
    * Deception
        * sometimes they can be used to deceive the enemy about the main forces location
    * Strategic Location
        * consideration
            * Quick Response
            * Access to Main Supply Routes
                * for quick movement
            * Enemy Penetration Points
                * where the enemy might attack us
            * Terrain
                * for good cover and concealment (not easily detected)
            * Cover and Concealment

* Movement and protection
    * Reserves must be able to
        * move quickly to any crisis point
    * Defensive Measures
        * visual stealth (camouflage)
        * electronic stealth (camouflage)

* Reserves doesn't have a mission, they have a simple task
    * reasons
        * it is uncommitted force
            * if it took a task, then it is committed and regular force
        * Flexibility and Responsiveness
            * if they had to put a plan then they are no longer flexible
        * The commander is the decision maker
            * this makes them executers only

* Example
    * Quick Reaction Force (QRF) 



# Combat Operations: Daylight vs. Limited-Visibility

## I. Daylight Operations
*   **Definition**: operations conducted during daytime
*   **Advantages**:
    *   **Equipment Use**: More equipments can be used
    *   **Control of Maneuver**: Easy troops direction and coordination, because they see each other.
    *   **Stress Reduction**: A lot more easier for soldiers to operate in the daylight
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   **Enemy Effectiveness**: Enemy is more efficient
    *   **Loss of Technical Overmatch**: You lose the advantage of your high tech equipments.

## II. Limited-Visibility Operations
*   **Definition**: operations conducted under reduced visibility conditions, such as at night, fog, ...
*   **Categories of Limited-Visibility Conditions**:
    *   **Technology-Overcomable**: night => night vision googles
    *   **Technology-Unovercomable**: dust, smoke, heavy rain, snow, fog, thick vegetation, ...
*   **General Characteristics**:
    *   **Deliberate Nature**:
        *   require more careful planning and slower execution compared to daylight operations
        *   due to the increased challenges
        *   Imagine trying to set up a complex tent in the dark !!
    *   **Exceptions**: 
        *   follow-up to a daylight attack
        *   exploitation (taking advantage of a shattered enemy)
        *   pursuit (chasing a retreating enemy)
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   **Control Issues**:
        *   It's much harder to manage and direct your units, when you can't see them clearly or their targets
        *   i.e.
            *   A commander might struggle to ensure all his platoons are advancing in the correct direction, if radio communication is not there, and visual signs are absent
    *   **Targeting Difficulties**: Identifying and accurately hitting enemy targets becomes challenging
    *   **Navigation and Movement**: 
        *   Moving without being detected is harder
        *   soldiers can easily get lost or stumble into unexpected enemy positions
        *   i.e.
            *   Strategy
                *   if the enemy is succeeding in tech, you can face him with ambushes
    *   **Casualty Management**: Locating, providing first aid to, and evacuating injured soldiers is significantly more difficult
    *   **Obstacle Handling**: 
        *   Finding, going around, or breaking through enemy obstacles is a major challenge. 
        *   Units might waste critical time trying to find a safe path through a wired fence they can barely see.
*   **Advantages (When Trained & Equipped)**:
    *   **Superiority over Unprepared Enemy**
    *   **Concealment**: 
        *   Darkness or bad weather can hide the movement and positions of large military forces.
    *   **Psychological Impact**: 
        *   Attackers can create more shock, confusion, and isolation among the enemy
    *   **Air Support**: 
        *   Airplanes and helicopters can operate more easily because enemy air defenders relying on optical sights struggle to acquire targets at night.
    *   **Increased Surprise**: 
        *   Military deception tactics (like using fake lights or noise to trick the enemy) become more effective. 
        *   A unit might use decoy vehicle lights to make the enemy think they are attacking from one direction, while the real attack comes from another unseen flank.
*   **Organization and Planning Considerations**:
    *   **Noise and Light Discipline**: minimize noise and light to avoid detection
    *   **Illumination**:
        *   **Non-illuminated attacks** offer the highest chance of achieving surprise
        *   However, illumination to be available for immediate use in emergencies
        *   The decision of using illumination is critical and must be taken carefully
    *   **Planning Emphasis (Key Points)**:
        *   **Simplicity**: to avoid confusion in a low-visibility environment
        *   **Reconnaissance**: The more you know, the higher the success chances
        *   **Control Measures**: Use clear roads/building/features, don't confuse the team
        *   **Rehearsals**: Conduct them in the daylight initially, and in the night later
*   **Assumption of Enemy Capabilities**:
    *   **Assume Equality**: This prevents complacency (self satisfaction)
    *   **Close Movement**: soldiers or vehicles can keep track of each other more easily and react faster




### Employment of Direct Fires

Shooting at targets you can see directly should be effective, lethal (deadly), and safe

*   **Field of Fire**
    *   Effective shooting area
*   **Fire Control Measures**
    *   Rules and tools a leader uses to tell their soldiers when, where, and how to shoot
    *   To make sure everyone focuses their firepower on the most important targets, prevents friendly fire (fratricide), and uses ammunition efficiently.
    *   **Examples of Measures**:
        *   **Sector of Fire**: Each solider has his sector to shoot at
        *   **Trigger**: Shoot after the vehicle cross the bridge
        *   **Target Reference Point (TRP)**: 20 meter right to the building

### Principles for Direct Fire Planning and Control

*   **1. Destroy the Greatest Threat First**
    *   Always shoot at the enemy who can do you the most harm immediately.
*   **2. Massed fire**
    *   Don't spread your fire out randomly. Focus firepower on a critical enemy point to achieve a decisive (final) result
*   **3. Employ the Best Weapon for the Specific Target**
    *   Use the right tool for the right job. This saves ammunition and is more effective.
*   **4. Avoid Target Overkill**
    *   Use just enough firepower to destroy a target, and no more. Wasting ammunition on one target means you have less for the next one.
*   **5. Minimize Exposure**
    *   Don't make yourself an easy target. Only expose yourself to enemy fire for the absolute minimum time required to be effective.
*   **6. Plan and Implement Control Measures**
    *   Before the battle, draw the lines and set the rules (fire control measures) to prevent chaos and friendly fire
*   **7. Plan for Limited-Visibility Conditions**
    *   The dark, fog, or smoke shouldn't stop you. Prepare for fighting when you can't see well
*   **8. Plan for Degraded Capabilities**
    *   Things will go wrong. Weapons will break, people will get hurt. Have a backup plan

### Post-Combat Actions

Critical actions a unit takes after a fight to maintain its strength and prepare for the next mission

*   **Consolidate**
    *   **Definition**: [To organize and strengthen a position you just captured so you can defend it from an enemy counter-attack.]
    *   **Explanation**: [Winning a piece of ground is only half the battle; now you have to keep it. Consolidation is the immediate, fast-paced process of turning your offense into a defense.]
    *   **Military Example**: [A platoon successfully assaults and captures an enemy-held hilltop. The fight is over, but they immediately **consolidate**. This involves:
        1.  **Security**: Spreading out to form a 360-degree perimeter, watching for any enemy trying to retake the hill.
        2.  **Eliminate Resistance**: Sweeping the hilltop to clear any remaining enemy soldiers hiding in bunkers.
        3.  **Reposition**: Moving machine guns to the best positions to repel a counter-attack.
        4.  **Adjust Fires**: Calling in their new position to artillery so they can get fire support if attacked.
        5.  **Resupply**: Distributing water and ammunition to every soldier.]
*   **Reconstitution**
    *   **Definition**: [The overall process of rebuilding a unit's combat power after it has taken heavy losses.]
    *   **Explanation**: [This is about restoring a unit's ability to fight effectively. It is divided into two main parts: a quick fix (Reorganization) and a long-term rebuild (Regeneration).]
    *   **Reorganization (The Quick Fix)**
        *   **Definition**: [Using the resources you still have *within the unit* to patch it up and keep it in the fight.]
        *   **Military Example**: [A tank platoon of four tanks gets into a heavy fight. One tank is destroyed, and the commander of another is wounded. The platoon is down to 75% strength. The platoon leader performs an **immediate reorganization**. He tells the gunner of the damaged tank to take command. He then takes the two surviving crewmen from the destroyed tank and has them join another tank that had lost a crewman, bringing it back to full strength. He does all of this on the battlefield in minutes to continue the mission.]
    *   **Regeneration (The Full Rebuild)**
        *   **Definition**: [Pulling a unit completely out of the fight and sending it to a rear area to be rebuilt with large-scale replacements of people, equipment, and supplies.]
        *   **Military Example**: [After a week of intense fighting, a battalion has lost 40% of its soldiers and most of its vehicles are damaged. The unit is combat ineffective. The high command orders it to **regenerate**. The entire battalion is moved 50 miles behind the front lines. Over the next two weeks, they receive hundreds of new replacement soldiers, brand new vehicles, and a full stock of supplies. They spend the time training the new soldiers and integrating them into the existing squads until the entire battalion is back to 100% strength and ready to return to combat.]
