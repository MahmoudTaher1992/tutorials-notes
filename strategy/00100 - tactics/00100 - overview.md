# Tactics overview




## Definitions


### Strategy

* The big why and what
* No detailed commands
* You have to divide it into small chunks, to be executed (here comes the tactics)

### Operation

* A series of tactical actions with a common purpose
* a small step in achieving the strategy goal
* i.e.
    * If you want to win a football season, an operation is winning a single match
    * If you want to defeat enemy (X), you have to take city (Y) which acts as a supply line for him
        * the strategy is defeat enemy
        * the operation is take city

### Tactics

* Tactics are the employment, ordered arrangement and directed actions of forces in relation to each other.
* i.e.
    * If you want to take city Y (operation), 
        * You can't just send everyone running at the city, You need a plan made of smaller tactical actions
        * here are the tactics
            * Tactic 1: Seize the Bridge
            * Tactic 2: Block Reinforcements
            * Tactic 3: Main Assault

### Maneuver

* Maneuver is movement in conjunction with fires... The purpose of maneuver is to gain and exploit (derive benefit from) positions of relative advantage to accomplish the mission.
* Maneuver isn't just "moving.", 
* It's moving smartly to get an advantage or putting the enemy in a worse position, and you almost always do it with the help of shooting ("fires").
* i.e.
    * in Seize the Bridge Tactic
        * you found a machine gun bunker defending the entrance
            * you can not just order the soldiers to move to it, that would be a disaster.
            * instead you put the bunker under a machine gun from your side, to reduce or stop their ability of firing with accuracy
            * another squad should move while the first one is shooting, to a ditch on the side of the bunker where the bunker can not shoot at
            * once they are there, they can eliminate the bunker with grenades

### Warfighting Functions Integration and Synchronization

* Every commander should use the following tools
    * Command and Control (C2)
        * The commander's brain and voice
        * the process of making decisions
        * Communicating orders

    * Movement and Maneuver
        * The unit's legs and fists.
    
    * Intelligence
        * The unit's eyes and ears
        * i.e.
            * spies
            * drones
            * scouts
            * ...

    * Fires
        * The unit's long-range punch
        * i.e.
            * artillery cannons
            * mortars
            * attack aircraft
            * ...

    * Sustainment
        * The unit's lifeblood
        * logistical and medical support

    * Protection
        * The unit's shield
        * everything that keeps your soldiers safe
        * i.e.
            * camouflage
            * building defensive trenches
            * air defense systems
            * ...

* Integration
    * usage of all possible tool/resources you have
    * i.e.
        * You don't plan an attack without thinking how you will get more ammo
    
* Synchronization 
    * each tool/resources should do the right action in the right time in the right place (in time, space, and purpose)

* Understanding the Operational Environment
    * you cannot make a good plan in a vacuum
        * it is a risky plan that doesn't respect the variables

### Operation types

* Offensive
    * you are the attacker, you win by force
    * you want to defeat the enemy and take something from them
        * i.e.
            * territory
            * resources
            * ...
* Defensive
    * You are holding your ground. The enemy is attacking you
    * repel the enemy, protect something, buy time
* Stability
    * create a safe and secure environment
    * establish basic services
    * Create a long-term, stable peace
* Enabling
    * special operations
    * enables you to do offensive or defensive actions
    * create the conditions needed for other operations to succeed


# The Operational Environment

* everything that can affect your mission, from the weather to the enemy's mood to the type of dirt on the ground
* OE domains
    * land
    * air
    * sea
    * space
        * where satellites operate
    * cyberspace
* Dimensions
    * physical
        * anything you can see and measure
    * human
        * every thing about people
        * Commanders who ignore this dimension often lose
        * i.e.
            * morale, training level, culture, religion, relationships, fear, and belief
    * information

* Commander must
    * look beyond their own troops and their enemy in front of them, they must consider everything
        * This enables the commander to see problems, before they become disasters
    * must plan to deal with potential outcomes
        * i.e.
            * if you think that the enemy might surrender, then you have to prepare prisons
    * understand the results of various actions
        * Friendly Actions
            * if the attack succeeded so quickly, we push without a pause, this might cause supply lines stretch, we might not be able to defend against counter-attacks 
        * Enemy Actions
            * if the enemy decided to fight till the end, the operation might take weeks with lots of casualties
        * Adversary Actions
            * a non direct enemy moved his army near the boarders of the city
        * Neutral Actions
            * a red cross aid is scheduled at the day of the operation in the roads that we want to use, we should choose another time/roads

        * i.e.
            * if the enemy is new, then he might not have all info about the defenses yet, this is an advantage

* Commanders must constantly refine and update their understanding of the operational variables


# Mission Variables

* specific

* METT-TC
    * Mission
        * What have I been ordered to do
    * Enemy
        * capabilities
        * number
        * guns
    * Terrain (and Weather)
    * Troops available
        * your own forces
    * Time available
    * Civil considerations
        * Are there civilians nearby?
        * how will my mission affect them?
        * How will civilians affect my mission

* Information is a lens that must be used to analyze it's effect of METT-TC
    * Mission + I
        * is there a video on the social media that shows our staging area, it shows we are preparing for something ?
    * Enemy + I
        * Is our radio un encrypted, Can the enemy hack us ? Can we hack them ?
        * Are they using emails that we can hack ?
    * Terrain + I
        * Are there a web cam that shows the location life 
    * Troops + I
        * Are the soldiers posting images on facebook with the equipments shown ?
    * Civil + I
        * Are the civilians posting images/videos for the attack ?

# The big picture

* every tactic is linked ot an operation, each operation is linked to the strategic objectives. (nothing is isolated)
    * tactics is nested within large military campaign
* working in isolation is useless and can cause the waste of resources
* military operations are joint and multinational in nature
    * joint means multiple branches of the same army work together on the same operation
    * multinational means multiple armies for multiple countries may work together on the same operation
* understanding the big picture converts the leaders from order-takers to problem solver

# Joint operations

* Joint operations 
    * operations where multiple forces are working together on the same mission
* Unified action
    * joint forces synchronizes its actions with all the other players on the "team."
* Unity of Effort
    * getting everyone rowing in the same direction, to achieve the goal
* strategic roles
    * Shape Operational Environments
        * preventative medicine
        * shape the operational environment, to prevent the war from happening in the first place
    * Counter Aggression on Land During Crisis
        * de-escalate the crisis and deter (prevent from happening) a larger conflict.
    * Prevail in Large-Scale Ground Combat
        * warfighting
        * Deterrence has failed, and war has begun
        * To win the war
    * Consolidate Gains
        * turn military victory into a stable, long-term political success


# Multi Domain operations

* MDO is the idea that to defeat a powerful enemy, the army must attack in all domains at the same time
    * Land, Air, Sea, Space and Cyberspace
    * reduce the effectiveness of the enemy by making him confused and paralyzed
* MDO is a Team Sport
    * no military division can do it alone !!
* A Two-Way Street of Capabilities
    * each member in the joint team gives (it's capabilities) the team and gets (other's capabilities) from it
* ALL Army Operations are Multidomain
    * Army can not function without satellites (space domain)
    * Army can not function in some operations without air support (Air domain)
    * ...
* Scale matters
    * Number matters
        * if you have large forces, you can attack, defend in the same time
        * if you don't, you can do one thing at a time.

# General Considerations for Tactics

* Tactics are methods used to win a battle
    * it is not about using more soldiers or bigger guns
    * it is about using what you have in the smartest way possible

* Tactics plan composition
    * Any tactical plan can be broken down into 3 main activities
        * employment
            * using all your tools together at the right time
            * sparing tools that can be used is a bad tactic
        * Arrangement
            * place your pieces at the best places
            * i.e.
                * hit the enemy where it is weak
        * Directed Actions
            * giving clear orders
            * each unit should know
                * what its specific job
                * why it's important for the overall plan

* The Warfighting Functions (The commander's toolbox)
    * they must be used together to achieve the goal
    * functions
        * Command and Control (brian)
        * Movement and Maneuver (force on ground)
        * Intelligence
        * Fires
        * Sustainment
        * Protection

* Combat power
    * the total fighting ability a unit can bring into a battle
    * it is not about the weapons only
    * you have to generate enough combat power to defeat the enemy
    * combat power ingredients
        * Leadership
            * good leaders is a power to the army
            * search for a strong leader
        * Firepower
        * Information
        * Mobility
            * the ability to move quickly
        * Survivability
            * The ability to take a hit and keep fighting.

# Command and Control (C2) Warfighting Function

* it is The Brain and Nervous System of the military operation
    * it makes the other warfighting functions work together smoothly and effectively
* C2 Goal
    * use all parts effectively
    * synchronized them
    * make them all focused on the same goal 
* C2 result
    * derive the highest combat power
* Commanders role
    * state the mission (what to be done)
    * state the intent (why and what a successful outcome should be)
* Sub commanders' role
    * translate the vision into detailed plans and orders
    * make sure everyone has the right resources
* Communication Challenges
    * clear communications, can be intercepted by the enemy
    * try to make the communications as low as possible
    * enemy can locate you and target you because of communication exposure
    * units need clear pre practiced SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) for how to operate when communications are difficult, ensuring they can still achieve their mission with minimal guidance
