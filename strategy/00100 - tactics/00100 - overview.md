# Tactics overview




## Definitions


### Strategy

* The big why and what
* No detailed commands
* You have to divide it into small chunks, to be executed (here comes the tactics)

### Operation

* A series of tactical actions with a common purpose
* a small step in achieving the strategy goal
* i.e.
    * If you want to win a football season, an operation is winning a single match
    * If you want to defeat enemy (X), you have to take city (Y) which acts as a supply line for him
        * the strategy is defeat enemy
        * the operation is take city

### Tactics

* Tactics are the employment, ordered arrangement and directed actions of forces in relation to each other.
* i.e.
    * If you want to take city Y (operation), 
        * You can't just send everyone running at the city, You need a plan made of smaller tactical actions
        * here are the tactics
            * Tactic 1: Seize the Bridge
            * Tactic 2: Block Reinforcements
            * Tactic 3: Main Assault

### Maneuver

* Movement
    * act of displacing forces from point A to point B
* Maneuver
    * movement in conjunction with fires
    * to gain and exploit (derive benefit from) positions of relative advantage to accomplish the mission.
    * isn't just "moving."
        * It's moving smartly 
        * to get an advantage 
        * or putting the enemy in a worse position
    * you almost always do it with the help of shooting ("fires").
* i.e.
    * in Seize the Bridge Tactic
        * you found a machine gun bunker defending the entrance
            * you can not just order the soldiers to move to it, that would be a disaster.
            * instead you put the bunker under a machine gun from your side, to reduce or stop their ability of firing with accuracy
            * another squad should move while the first one is shooting, to a ditch on the side of the bunker where the bunker can not shoot at
            * once they are there, they can eliminate the bunker with grenades

### Warfighting Functions Integration and Synchronization

* Every commander should use the following tools
    * Command and Control (C2)
        * The commander's brain and voice
        * the process of making decisions
        * Communicating orders

    * Movement and Maneuver
        * The unit's legs and fists.
    
    * Intelligence
        * The unit's eyes and ears
        * i.e.
            * spies
            * drones
            * scouts
            * ...

    * Fires
        * The unit's long-range punch
        * i.e.
            * artillery cannons
            * mortars
            * attack aircraft
            * ...

    * Sustainment
        * The unit's lifeblood
        * logistical and medical support

    * Protection
        * The unit's shield
        * everything that keeps your soldiers safe
        * i.e.
            * camouflage
            * building defensive trenches
            * air defense systems
            * ...

* Integration
    * usage of all possible tool/resources you have
    * i.e.
        * You don't plan an attack without thinking how you will get more ammo
    
* Synchronization 
    * each tool/resources should do the right action in the right time in the right place (in time, space, and purpose)

* Understanding the Operational Environment
    * you cannot make a good plan in a vacuum
        * it is a risky plan that doesn't respect the variables

### Operation types

* Offensive
    * you are the attacker, you win by force
    * you want to defeat the enemy and take something from them
        * i.e.
            * territory
            * resources
            * ...
* Defensive
    * You are holding your ground. The enemy is attacking you
    * repel the enemy, protect something, buy time
* Stability
    * create a safe and secure environment
    * establish basic services
    * Create a long-term, stable peace
* Enabling
    * special operations
    * enables you to do offensive or defensive actions
    * create the conditions needed for other operations to succeed


# The Operational Environment

* everything that can affect your mission, from the weather to the enemy's mood to the type of dirt on the ground
* OE domains
    * land
    * air
    * sea
    * space
        * where satellites operate
    * cyberspace
* Dimensions
    * physical
        * anything you can see and measure
    * human
        * every thing about people
        * Commanders who ignore this dimension often lose
        * i.e.
            * morale, training level, culture, religion, relationships, fear, and belief
    * information

* Commander must
    * look beyond their own troops and their enemy in front of them, they must consider everything
        * This enables the commander to see problems, before they become disasters
    * must plan to deal with potential outcomes
        * i.e.
            * if you think that the enemy might surrender, then you have to prepare prisons
    * understand the results of various actions
        * Friendly Actions
            * if the attack succeeded so quickly, we push without a pause, this might cause supply lines stretch, we might not be able to defend against counter-attacks 
        * Enemy Actions
            * if the enemy decided to fight till the end, the operation might take weeks with lots of casualties
        * Adversary Actions
            * a non direct enemy moved his army near the boarders of the city
        * Neutral Actions
            * a red cross aid is scheduled at the day of the operation in the roads that we want to use, we should choose another time/roads


# OPERATIONAL VARIABLES

* Generic
* PMESII-PT
    * Political
        * Who has the power and authority?
        * who is officially in charge ?
        * who is unofficially in charge ? (like a tribal leader or powerful family)
        * What are their goals ?

            * formal (banks, factories) or informal (black markets, bartering)
            * major industries
            * Who controls the wealth
            * levels of unemployment
        * i.e.
            * secure the food processing plant, to keep the people with you
            * take over the oil refinery, to cut the cash from the insurgents

    * Social
        * How do the people live and interact with each other?

            * who do they trust
        * i.e.
            * if you name the operation something in conflict with their values, they might turn on you

    * Information
        * How do people get their information and what do they believe?
        * How to get information about every thing ?

    * Infrastructure

    * Physical Environment
        * What is the land and weather like?

    * Time
        * How does the timing of events, culture, and our own operations affect the situation?
        * i.e.
            * if the enemy is new, then he might not have all info about the defenses yet, this is an advantage

* Commanders must constantly refine and update their understanding of the operational variables


# Mission Variables

* specific

* METT-TC
    * Mission
        * What have I been ordered to do
    * Enemy
        * capabilities
        * number
        * guns
    * Terrain (and Weather)
    * Troops available
        * your own forces
    * Time available
    * Civil considerations
        * Are there civilians nearby?
        * how will my mission affect them?
        * How will civilians affect my mission

* Information is a lens that must be used to analyze it's effect of METT-TC
    * Mission + I
        * is there a video on the social media that shows our staging area, it shows we are preparing for something ?
    * Enemy + I
        * Is our radio un encrypted, Can the enemy hack us ? Can we hack them ?
        * Are they using emails that we can hack ?
    * Terrain + I
        * Are there a web cam that shows the location life 
    * Troops + I
        * Are the soldiers posting images on facebook with the equipments shown ?
    * Civil + I
        * Are the civilians posting images/videos for the attack ?

# The big picture

* every tactic is linked ot an operation, each operation is linked to the strategic objectives. (nothing is isolated)
    * tactics is nested within large military campaign
* working in isolation is useless and can cause the waste of resources
* military operations are joint and multinational in nature
    * joint means multiple branches of the same army work together on the same operation
    * multinational means multiple armies for multiple countries may work together on the same operation
* understanding the big picture converts the leaders from order-takers to problem solver

# Joint operations

* Joint operations 
    * operations where multiple forces are working together on the same mission
* Unified action
    * joint forces synchronizes its actions with all the other players on the "team."
* Unity of Effort
    * getting everyone rowing in the same direction, to achieve the goal
* strategic roles
    * Shape Operational Environments
        * preventative medicine
        * shape the operational environment, to prevent the war from happening in the first place
    * Counter Aggression on Land During Crisis
        * de-escalate the crisis and deter (prevent from happening) a larger conflict.
    * Prevail in Large-Scale Ground Combat
        * warfighting
        * Deterrence has failed, and war has begun
        * To win the war
    * Consolidate Gains
        * turn military victory into a stable, long-term political success


# Multi Domain operations

* MDO is the idea that to defeat a powerful enemy, the army must attack in all domains at the same time
    * Land, Air, Sea, Space and Cyberspace
    * reduce the effectiveness of the enemy by making him confused and paralyzed
* MDO is a Team Sport
    * no military division can do it alone !!
* A Two-Way Street of Capabilities
    * each member in the joint team gives (it's capabilities) the team and gets (other's capabilities) from it
* ALL Army Operations are Multidomain
    * Army can not function without satellites (space domain)
    * Army can not function in some operations without air support (Air domain)
    * ...
* Scale matters
    * Number matters
        * if you have large forces, you can attack, defend in the same time
        * if you don't, you can do one thing at a time.

# General Considerations for Tactics

* Tactics are methods used to win a battle
    * it is not about using more soldiers or bigger guns
    * it is about using what you have in the smartest way possible

* Tactics plan composition
    * Any tactical plan can be broken down into 3 main activities
        * employment
            * using all your tools together at the right time
            * sparing tools that can be used is a bad tactic
        * Arrangement
            * place your pieces at the best places
            * i.e.
                * hit the enemy where it is weak
        * Directed Actions
            * giving clear orders
            * each unit should know
                * what its specific job
                * why it's important for the overall plan

* The Warfighting Functions (The commander's toolbox)
    * they must be used together to achieve the goal
    * functions
        * Command and Control (brian)
        * Movement and Maneuver (force on ground)
        * Intelligence
        * Fires
        * Sustainment
        * Protection

* Combat power
    * the total fighting ability a unit can bring into a battle
    * it is not about the weapons only
    * you have to generate enough combat power to defeat the enemy
    * combat power ingredients
        * Leadership
            * good leaders is a power to the army
            * search for a strong leader
        * Firepower
        * Information
        * Mobility
            * the ability to move quickly
        * Survivability
            * The ability to take a hit and keep fighting.

# Command and Control (C2) Warfighting Function

* it is The Brain and Nervous System of the military operation
    * it makes the other warfighting functions work together smoothly and effectively
* C2 Goal
    * use all parts effectively
    * synchronized them
    * make them all focused on the same goal 
* C2 result
    * derive the highest combat power
* Commanders role
    * state the mission (what to be done)
    * state the intent (why and what a successful outcome should be)
* Sub commanders' role
    * translate the vision into detailed plans and orders
    * make sure everyone has the right resources
* Communication Challenges
    * clear communications, can be intercepted by the enemy
    * try to make the communications as low as possible
    * enemy can locate you and target you because of communication exposure
    * units need clear pre practiced SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) for how to operate when communications are difficult, ensuring they can still achieve their mission with minimal guidance

# Hasty and Deliberate Operations

* Hasty
    * a surprise
    * You see an opportunity
    * You want to take advantage
    * high risk
    * minimal time for planning
    * Speed is the key advantage

* Deliberate
    * Goal
        * Achieve a complex objective
    * Planning
        * Slow and detailed
    * Perfection and coordination are more important
    * Lower risk during the action

# Tactical Framework

* four-step recipe for planning and executing almost any military operation
* works with
    * attacking
    * defending
* breaks down a complex operation into 4 logical phases
* phases
    * Find
        * you can not fight what you can not find
        * locate the enemy
        * use what ever tools you have to pinpoint the enemy
        * you have also to know every thing possible about them
    * Fix
        * you have to fix your enemy, pin them down
        * you don't want them running away, maybe moving to a better position
        * fixing them will allow you to set them up for the main blow
    * Finish
        * you apply your overwhelming combat power to break the enemy and finish the mission
    * Follow Through
        * Winning the fight is not the end !!
        * hunt down any remaining enemy fighters
        * reorganize your troops
        * treat the wounded
        * prepare for the next mission

# Battle Drill

* It is a set of simple, practiced steps to respond to a common battlefield event
    * it requires lots of drills to train the troops
* Allows soldiers to react correctly and instantly turning a chaotic moment into a controlled response
    * in the chaos of combat, there will be no time to think and plan
    * Speed is life
* The trigger is called a cue
    * i.e.
        * enemy fire
        * a leader's especial command
* Goal
    * take immediate, effective actions to keep the soldiers alive
    * regain advantage over the enemy



# Battle handover

* a formal transfer of an active gunfight from one unit to another
* used tom maintain momentum of the combat power
    * done by bringing fresh units and allowing tired units to leave
* Battle Handover Line
    * a specific line drawn on the map
    * when a fresh unit reaches it, the responsibility of the gunfight is transferred from the old unit to the new one
* types
    * Passage of Lines
        * A fresh unit moves through a tired unit to continue an attack
    * Relief in Place
        * A fresh unit comes in to replace a tired unit in a defensive position
    * Breakout of an Encirclement
        * A rescue force breaks through to a trapped unit



# Control Measures

* it is like instruction manual in the battlefield
* are rules that help in
    * preventing chaos in the battlefield
    * action coordination
    * prevent friendly fire
    * give freedom/restriction  where possible

* types
    * permission
        * Permissive Measures
            * Green Lights
            * i.e.
                * Behind a phase line, artillery can shoot freely
        * Restrictive Measures
            * Red Lights
            * i.e.
                * Don't pass the boundary line, otherwise you will be considered an enemy
    * views
        * graphical symbols on maps
            * digital
                * maps on screens
                * updatable
            * analog
                * printed map in pockets
                * can not be hacked
        * rules in leaders mind



# Terrain Management

* the art of assigning specific pieces of ground to specific units
    * to keep things organized and prevent friendly fire
* assignment ways
    * Area of operations
        * a complete area given to a unit 
        * it is responsible for everything inside it
        * lots of power, lots of responsibilities
    * Zone
        * used in offense
        * has a starting line, left and right boundaries, no end line
    * sector
        * used in defense
        * a part of a terrain where a commander is responsible for it's defense
        * a coordination must happen between the sectors to close the gap between them

# Forms of contact

* contact
    * any interaction with another force
    * advantage
        * the best for is one way contact, where you are in contact with the enemy and he is out of contact with you
    * the most effective units use multiple forms of contact with the enemy to overwhelm him
    * types
        * the enemy and us are in contact
        * we are in contact, the enemy is not
        * the enemy is in contact, we are not
            * you should always suspect this

* forms of contact
    * visual
        * you saw the enemy
    * Electromagnetic
        * you saw him on the radio
    * Indirect
        * artillery is firing at him

        * stands for Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear
        * the enemy shot us with a chemical weapon
    * Influence
        * we have posted a video on social media, we are not going to go after the soldiers who leave their weapons
    * Non-hostile
        * we saw enemies' ambulance moving wounded

* Actions on contact
    * it is a process, not a drill
        * you have to follow the steps

    * steps
        * React
            * take cover
            * return fire to suppress the enemy
        * Develop the Situation
            * understand the situation, your advantages and risks
        * Choose action
            * handle the enemy, avoid, retreat
        * Execute the action and report

# Tactical Mission Tasks

* ensures everyone is speaking the same language
* very specific, standardized verb that tells a military unit exactly what action to perform
* The military has a whole dictionary of these tasks (each one has a precise meaning)
* i.e.
    * Block
        * Stop an enemy from moving through a certain area
    * Seize
        * Clear a location of the enemy and physically occupy it
    * Destroy
        * Physically render an enemy force combat-ineffective. This is a very high standard.
    * Suppress
        * Use fire to prevent the enemy from firing back effectively
        * You're keeping their heads down so another unit can move
    * Fix
        * Pin an enemy in place with fire and/or obstacles so they cannot move from their location

# Multinational Operations

* when the military forces from two or more different countries team up to achieve a common goal
    * i.e.
        * part of an official alliance
        * temporary coalition formed for a specific mission

* Opportunities
    * International Legitimacy
        * you will be accepted by the world
    * Different Authorities & Capabilities
        * Every country has it's special military power
        * combining them gives the commander more options to form a stronger combat power

* Challenges
    * communication issues
        * due to language differences
    * National caveats (Warnings)
        * every country has it's own laws and restrictions
        * this can limit the limits of the commander
            * i.e.
                * germans don't permit offensive attacks
                * US permits it
    * Interoperability concerns
        * the ability of different forces to work effectively with each other 
            * i.e.
                * Does french air fighters transmit radio waves that can be heared by us tanks ?

* Solutions to the challenges
    * Liaison Officers
        * officers that facilitates the communication between multinational units
            * they should now military stuff, to be able to conduct and translate the communications
    * Simple Orders
    * Train Together



# Local Security

* A security system for a military unit in the field
* formation of protective bubble 
    * location
        * around the military unit
    * goal
        * prevent the enemy from launching a surprise attack
            * a surprise attack
                * incredibly dangerous
        * maintaining the initiative
            * if you lost the initiative, you will no longer be in control
            * ensures that you see the enemy first, allowing you to keep control of the situation
    * how
        * small activities near the unit
            * Avoiding enemy detection
                * If they can't see you, they can't attack you.
            * actively looking for the enemy around you

* Methods
    * Active Measures (Proactively Looking for Danger)
        * Observation Posts
            * Placing a few soldiers in a hidden spot with a good view
                * Their only job is to watch for enemy movement and report back
            * static observer
            * cons
                * Dead Ground
                * Passive
                    * they wait for the enemy
                * Predictable
                * Limited Information
        * Patrols

                * Close and detailed information
                * drawing force (drawing the enemy into the trap)
        * Establishing Levels of Alert / SOPs
            * i.e.
                * low alert
                    * 25% of the unit is awake
                * high alert
                    * 50%-100% of the unit is awake

    * Passive Measures (making yourself hard to find)
        * Camouflage
        * Movement Control
            * minimize the signatures created by your movement
                * to prevent the enemy from detecting you
        * Noise and Light Discipline
        * Electromagnetic Protection
            * detection can come waves coming out of your location
        * Use of 
            * Sensors
            * Night Vision
            * Sights


# Reserves

* definition
    * a group of troops a commander holds back from the initial fighting of the battle

* importance
    * Flexibility and Adaptability
        * gives the commander ability to respond to unexpected situations
    * Exploiting Success
        * take advantage of a weak spot in the right time
            * in the battle, some of the forces can find this weak spot, if a reserve was not there we lose this opportunity
    * Preventing Failure
        * if another force is about to fail, they can jump in and prevent the failure
    * Regaining Initiative
    
* Commanders Decisions
    * When to commit
        * reserve utilization is one of the hardest decisions
        * it should be taken
            * in the best time
            * the best place
            * the best circumstances

    * Not for routine tasks
        * routine tasks are trivial and reserves are made for critical missions
    * No Support Assets in Reserve
        * you should not put artillery in reserve

* Re-forming a Reserve
    * if the reserve is used, units should create a new Reserve
        * a commander can assign the reserve role for another unit
    * units must never rely on the commander sending them the reserve
        * they should deal with the situation
        * you plans should always be like this
            * depend on what you have
            * not on what others have

* Where to place
    * Generally to the Rear
        * protection
        * ability to attack
    * Beyond Direct Fire Range
        * so the enemy can not shoot them
    * Deception
        * sometimes they can be used to deceive the enemy about the main forces location
    * Strategic Location
        * consideration
            * Quick Response
            * Access to Main Supply Routes
                * for quick movement
            * Enemy Penetration Points
                * where the enemy might attack us
            * Terrain
                * for good cover and concealment (not easily detected)
            * Cover and Concealment

* Movement and protection
    * Reserves must be able to
        * move quickly to any crisis point
    * Defensive Measures
        * visual stealth (camouflage)
        * electronic stealth (camouflage)

* Reserves doesn't have a mission, they have a simple task
    * reasons
        * it is uncommitted force
            * if it took a task, then it is committed and regular force
        * Flexibility and Responsiveness
            * if they had to put a plan then they are no longer flexible
        * The commander is the decision maker
            * this makes them executers only

* Example
    * Quick Reaction Force (QRF) 



# Combat Operations: Daylight vs. Limited-Visibility

## I. Daylight Operations
*   **Definition**: [operations conducted during daytime]
*   **Advantages**:
    *   **Equipment Use**: [More equipments can be used]
    *   **Control of Maneuver**: [Easy troops direction and coordination, because they see each other.]
    *   **Stress Reduction**: [A lot more easier for soldiers to operate in the daylight]
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   **Enemy Effectiveness**: [Enemy is more efficient]
    *   **Loss of Technical Overmatch**: [You lose the advantage of your high tech equipments.]

## II. Limited-Visibility Operations
*   **Definition**: [operations conducted under reduced visibility conditions, such as at night, fog, ...]
*   **Categories of Limited-Visibility Conditions**:
    *   **Technology-Overcomable**: [night => night vision googles]
    *   **Technology-Unovercomable**: [dust, smoke, heavy rain, snow, fog, thick vegetation, ...]
*   **General Characteristics**:
    *   **Deliberate Nature**: [Operations in limited visibility usually require more careful planning and slower execution compared to daylight operations due to the increased challenges. Imagine trying to set up a complex tent in the dark; you'd take more time and be more cautious.]
    *   **Exceptions**: [Attacks that are part of a rapid follow-up to a daylight attack, an exploitation (taking advantage of a shattered enemy), or a pursuit (chasing a retreating enemy) might proceed quickly even in limited visibility.]
*   **Complications (Disadvantages) of Limited Visibility**:
    *   **Control Issues**: [It's much harder to manage and direct your units, individual soldiers, and their firepower (like artillery or machine guns) when you can't see them clearly or their targets. A commander might struggle to ensure all his platoons are advancing in the correct direction and coordinating their attacks if radio communication is intermittent and visual cues are absent.]
    *   **Targeting Difficulties**: [Identifying and accurately hitting enemy targets becomes challenging. A soldier might mistake a bush for an enemy soldier or be unable to distinguish between friendly and enemy vehicles.]
    *   **Navigation and Movement**: [Moving without being detected is harder, and soldiers can easily get lost or stumble into unexpected enemy positions. A patrol trying to sneak past enemy lines at night might accidentally walk into a concealed ambush position.]
    *   **Casualty Management**: [Locating, providing first aid to, and evacuating injured soldiers is significantly more difficult and time-consuming in the dark or poor weather. A medic might struggle to find a wounded soldier amidst the chaos and darkness.]
    *   **Obstacle Handling**: [Finding, going around, or breaking through enemy obstacles (like minefields or barbed wire) is a major challenge. Units might waste critical time trying to find a safe path through a wired fence they can barely see.]
*   **Advantages (When Trained & Equipped)**:
    *   **Superiority over Unprepared Enemy**: [Forces specifically trained and equipped for limited-visibility operations gain a major advantage over enemies who lack such capabilities. If your soldiers have advanced night-vision goggles and the enemy doesn't, your forces can move and fight effectively while the enemy is essentially blind.]
    *   **Concealment**: [Darkness or bad weather can hide the movement and positions of large military forces, both when attacking and defending.]
    *   **Psychological Impact**: [Attackers can create more shock, confusion, and isolation among the enemy. Imagine waking up to an attack in the middle of the night by an enemy you can't see; it's far more disorienting than a daylight assault.]
    *   **Air Support**: [Airplanes and helicopters can operate more easily in contested airspace because enemy air defenders relying on optical sights struggle to acquire targets at night.]
    *   **Increased Surprise**: [The element of surprise is greatly enhanced, and military deception tactics (like using fake lights or noise to trick the enemy) become more effective. A unit might use decoy vehicle lights to make the enemy think they are attacking from one direction, while the real attack comes from another unseen flank.]
*   **Organization and Planning Considerations**:
    *   **Task Organization**: [The way forces are organized for a limited-visibility operation is generally the same as for daylight, but changing that organization (rearranging teams or roles) takes more time and effort during low visibility.]
    *   **Noise and Light Discipline**: [It's crucial to minimize noise and light to avoid detection. For example, leaving a laser sight on a weapon could give away a soldier's position, eliminating the surprise advantage.]
    *   **Illumination**:
        *   **Non-illuminated attacks** [Attacks conducted without using artificial lights] offer the **highest chance of achieving surprise**.
        *   However, units **always plan for illumination to be available** [They prepare flares or spotlights], even if they intend to start in darkness. This allows them to quickly light up the area if needed, for example, once they make contact with the enemy.
        *   Leaders must **clearly understand** *when*, *under what conditions*, and *who has the authority* to use illumination.
    *   **Planning Emphasis (Key Points)**:
        *   **Simplicity**: [Keep the battle plan straightforward to avoid confusion in a low-visibility environment.]
        *   **Reconnaissance**: [Spend extra time scouting the area to understand the terrain and enemy positions, especially how they appear in the dark.]
        *   **Control Measures**: [Use easy-to-spot terrain features, like roads or railroad tracks, to establish clear boundaries and directions for units.]
        *   **Intermediate Objectives**: [Set smaller, achievable goals along the path of attack to help units stay on course and maintain direction.]
        *   **Concealment**: [Hide all preparations for the operation from enemy observation.]
        *   **Rehearsals**: [Conduct initial practice drills in daylight, and the final, most important rehearsal at night to simulate actual conditions.]
        *   **Security Elements**: [Position units specifically to protect the main force.]
*   **Assumption of Enemy Capabilities**:
    *   **Assume Equality**: [Always assume the enemy has similar night-fighting capabilities unless you have solid information proving otherwise. This prevents complacency.]
    *   **Terrain Masking Remains Key**: [Using features like hills, forests, or buildings to hide your movement and positions is still vital, even if it feels like the darkness offers enough protection.]
    *   **Close Movement**: [When moving, reduce the distance between soldiers or vehicles so they can keep track of each other more easily and react faster if they encounter the enemy. This is like holding hands with a friend in a dark, unfamiliar room so you don't get separated.]

## III. Summary of Advantages and Disadvantages (Table 1-1 Explained)

### A. Advantages of Limited-Visibility Operations
*   **Infiltration**: [It's easier to sneak past enemy defenses because they can't see your forces approaching clearly. Think of trying to sneak into a backyard at night versus during the day; you're much harder to spot in the dark.]
*   **Concealment**: [Darkness hides the movement of large groups of soldiers or vehicles, both when attacking and defending, allowing for surprise movements.]
*   **Psychological Edge**: [Attackers benefit from the shock, confusion, and feeling of isolation they can create in the enemy. Imagine being attacked by unseen forces in the middle of the night; it's terrifying and disorienting.]
*   **Air Operations**: [Aircraft can fly more safely in contested areas because enemy anti-aircraft defenses have a harder time spotting them with just optical sights.]
*   **Surprise**: [The element of surprise is significantly increased, and tricks to deceive the enemy (like making fake noise or showing false lights) are more effective.]

### B. Disadvantages of Limited-Visibility Operations
*   **Reserve Deployment**: [It's harder and slower for backup forces (reserves) to move into position and join the fight at night compared to daylight.]
*   **Control Issues**: [Directing and coordinating your troops becomes much more difficult without good visibility, especially if you don't have advanced night-vision technology.]
*   **Static vs. Moving Forces**: [Defending forces who are waiting in fixed positions can react more easily than attacking forces who are constantly moving and trying to navigate the darkness.]
*   **Weather Impact**: [Extreme weather (like blizzards or sandstorms) can prevent critical air support, including drones.]
*   **Obstacle Detection**: [Attacking forces struggle to fully understand the extent and layout of enemy obstacles (like minefields or trenches) in low visibility.]
*   **Terrain Navigation**: [Difficult terrain, like dense forests or rocky hills, becomes even harder and slower to cross in the dark.]
*   **Deception by Environment**: [The very conditions of low light, smoke, or noise can accidentally mislead *both* friendly and enemy forces.]
*   **Loss of Momentum**: [Attacking forces have to slow down to maintain cohesion and avoid getting separated, which reduces their attack speed and impact.]
*   **Land Navigation**: [Getting lost is a much higher risk at night; units can separate, lose their way, and support elements might end up in the wrong places.]
*   **Enemy Obstacle Emplacement**: [Defending forces can secretly set up new obstacles or move existing ones without being seen by your scouting teams.]
*   **Increased Ambush Risk**: [Attacking units are more vulnerable to ambushes at night because the enemy can hide and strike without being seen.]
*   **Indirect Fire Adjustment**: [Directing artillery or mortar fire accurately is tough, even with night-vision devices, as it's hard to see exactly where the shells are landing.]
*   **Ammunition Needs**: [Units need a lot more special signal ammunition, like tracer bullets (which glow so you can see where you're shooting), flares, and illumination rounds (to light up targets).]
*   **Casualty Management**: [Finding and getting injured soldiers to safety is significantly harder.]
*   **Fratricide Risk**: [The chance of accidentally harming or killing your own soldiers (friendly fire) increases dramatically due to poor visibility and confusion.]
*   **Reduced Weapon Range**: [The effective distance at which direct-fire weapons (like rifles and machine guns) can hit targets accurately decreases because of poor visibility, making it hard to spot and identify targets clearly.]
