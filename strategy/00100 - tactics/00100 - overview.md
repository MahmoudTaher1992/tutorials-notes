### Maneuver

* Maneuver is movement in conjunction with fires... The purpose of maneuver is to gain and exploit positions of relative advantage to accomplish the mission.
* Maneuver isn't just "moving.", 
* It's moving smartly to get an advantage, and you almost always do it with the help of shooting ("fires").
* i.e.
    * in Seize the Bridge Tactic
        * you found a machine gun bunker defending the entrance
            * you can not just order the soldiers to move to it, that would be a disaster.
            * instead you put the bunker under a machine gun from your side, to reduce or stop their ability of firing with accuracy
            * another squad should move while the first one is shooting, to a ditch on the side of the bunker where the bunker can not shoot at
            * once they are there, they can eliminate the bunker with grenades
