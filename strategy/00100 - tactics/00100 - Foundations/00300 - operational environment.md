* Commander must
    * look beyond their own troops and their enemy in front of them, they must consider everything
        * This enables the commander to see problems, before they become disasters
    * must plan to deal with potential outcomes
        * i.e.
            * if you think that the enemy might surrender, then you have to prepare prisons
    * understand the results of various actions
        * Friendly Actions
            * if the attack succeeded so quickly, we push without a pause, this might cause supply lines stretch, we might not be able to defend against counter-attacks 
        * Enemy Actions
            * if the enemy decided to fight till the end, the operation might take weeks with lots of casualties
        * Adversary Actions
            * a non direct enemy moved his army near the boarders of the city
        * Neutral Actions
            * a red cross aid is scheduled at the day of the operation in the roads that we want to use, we should choose another time/roads
