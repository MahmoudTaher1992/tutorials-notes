# The big picture

* every tactic is linked ot an operation, each operation is linked to the strategic objectives. (nothing is isolated)
    * tactics is nested within large military campaign
* working in isolation is useless and can cause the waste of resources
* military operations are joint and multinational in nature
    * joint means multiple branches of the same army work together on the same operation
    * multinational means multiple armies for multiple countries may work together on the same operation
* understanding the big picture converts the leaders from order-takers to problem solver
