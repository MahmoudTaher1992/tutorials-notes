React Lifecycle Methods
    render()
        render() is the only required method within a class component in React.

        it handles the rendering of your component to the UI. It happens during the mounting and updating of your component.

        the render() method returns JSX that is displayed in the UI. A render() can also return a null if there is nothing to 
        render for that component.

        A render() method has to be pure with no side-effects.
            It does not modify component state
            It returns the same result each time itâ€™s invoked
            It does not directly interact with the browser.
                If you need to interact with the browser, perform your work in componentDidMount() or the other lifecycle 
                methods instead. Keeping render() pure makes components easier to think about.

        This means that you can not setState() within a render().

        If you do need to modify state that would have to happen in the other lifecycle methods, therefore keeping render() pure.

        When called, it should examine this.props and this.state and return one of the following
            React elements
            Arrays and fragments
            Portals
            String and numbers
            Booleans or null > null renders nothing

        render() will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.
