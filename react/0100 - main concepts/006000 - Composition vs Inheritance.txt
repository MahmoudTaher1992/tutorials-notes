Composition
    few problems where developers new to React often reach for inheritance can be solved them with composition.

    Containment
        Some components don’t know their children ahead of time Use props.children > will be passed to FancyBorder in props.children
            <FancyBorder color="blue">
                <h1 className="Dialog-title">
                    Welcome
                </h1>
                <p className="Dialog-message">
                    Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!
                </p>
            </FancyBorder>

        You might need multiple “holes” in a component like if you want to pass right objects and left objects
        Use jsx props to solve this 
            <FancyBorder color="blue" rightObjects={<RightObjects />} leftObjects={<LeftObjects />} />

    Specialization
        WelcomeDialog that inherits from Dialog
            function Dialog(props) {
                return (
                    <FancyBorder color="blue">
                        <h1 className="Dialog-title">
                            {props.title}
                        </h1>
                        <p className="Dialog-message">
                            {props.message}
                        </p>
                    </FancyBorder>
                );
            }

            function WelcomeDialog() {
                return (
                    <Dialog
                    title="Welcome"
                    message="Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!" />
                );
            }

Inheritance
    In facebook they have thousands of components and they never needed inheritance
