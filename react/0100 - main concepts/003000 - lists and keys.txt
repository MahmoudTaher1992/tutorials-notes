Lists
    including React Elements array in curly braces will result into a list of dom elements after rendering

    i.e.
        {
            numbers.map((n) => <li key={n.toString()}>{n}</li>)
        }

Keys
    Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed

    The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings

    You can use items indexes but it will negatively impact performance if the order of items changed

    The key should be with the react element nearest to map > not in the child react element

    Key is not passed through props > use another name i.e (id)
