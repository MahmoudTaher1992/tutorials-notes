React Lifecycle Methods
    getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)

        Invoked right before the most recently rendered output is committed to e.g. the DOM. 
        
        It enables your component to capture some information from the DOM (e.g. scroll position) 
        before it is potentially changed. 
        
        Any value returned by this lifecycle method will be passed as a parameter to componentDidUpdate().

        A snapshot value (or null) should be returned.

        capture scroll position and apply it after DOM updates
