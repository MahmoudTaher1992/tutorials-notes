React Lifecycle Methods
    getDerivedStateFromProps()
        Invoked right before calling the render method, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates. 
        It should return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing.

        This method exists for rare use cases where the state depends on changes in props over time

        For example, it might be handy for implementing a <Transition> component that compares its previous and next children to
        decide which of them to animate in and out.

        Deriving state leads to verbose code and makes your components difficult to think about. Make sure you’re familiar with 
        simpler alternatives

        This method doesn’t have access to the component instance (Because it is static method)
