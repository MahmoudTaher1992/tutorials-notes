React Lifecycle Methods
    You can think of React lifecycle methods as the series of events that happen from the birth of a React component to its death.

    I like to think of them as going through a cycle of birth, growth, and death.
        Mounting – Birth of your component
        Update – Growth of your component
        Unmount – Death of your component
