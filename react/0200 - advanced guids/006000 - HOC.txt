HOC
    HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern

    higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component

    Whereas a component transforms props into UI, a higher-order component transforms a component into another component.

    Cross-Cutting Concerns
        logging
        data subscription

    Don’t Mutate the Original Component. Use Composition
        if you mutated and used another HOC that also mutates > the second will override the logic of the first

    Caveats
        Don’t Use HOCs Inside the render Method
        Refs Aren’t Passed Through
