Introducing Hooks
    Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8

    it lets you use state and other React features without writing a class.

    Motivation
        It’s hard to reuse stateful logic between components
            With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. 
            Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. 
            This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.

        Complex components become hard to understand
            Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related 
            (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data),

        Classes confuse both people and machines
            we’ve found that classes can be a large barrier to learning React.

            You have to remember to bind the event handlers.

            People can understand props, state, and top-down data flow perfectly well but still struggle with classes

            Hooks let you use more of React’s features without classes.

    There are no plans to remove classes from React.
