React Lifecycle Methods
    shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
        Use shouldComponentUpdate() to let React know if a component’s output is not affected by the current change in state 
        or props. 
        
        The default behavior is to re-render on every state change, and in the vast majority of cases you should rely on 
        the default behavior.

        shouldComponentUpdate() is invoked before rendering when new props or state are being received. Defaults to true. 
        
        This method is not called for the initial render or when forceUpdate() is used.

        This method only exists as a performance optimization. Do not rely on it to “prevent” a rendering, 
        as this can lead to bugs. 
        
        Consider using the built-in PureComponent instead of writing shouldComponentUpdate() by hand.
        PureComponent performs a shallow comparison of props and state, and reduces the chance that you’ll skip a 
        necessary update.

        Return false to tell React the update can be skipped

        We do not recommend doing deep equality checks or using JSON.stringify() in shouldComponentUpdate(). 
        It is very inefficient and will harm performance.
