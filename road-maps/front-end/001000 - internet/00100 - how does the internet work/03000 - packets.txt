Packets
    > Data on the internet is divided into small parts of info that is called Packets
    
    > each packet has a header that contains
        > sender ip address
        > destination ip address
        > used by routers to direct the packet to the right destination

    > The recipient computer gathers and combines all the packets together to get the full message

    > The data can be transferred as a whole without dividing it into packets but there will be a big delay
        > the message will have to wait for the proceeder message to be delivered to start its journey
