Encryption
    > The process of changing the data from an understandable form into another form that can not be understood by the hackers in the middle
    > this transformation protects the data
    > to decrypt it you need to have the encryption keys
    > the keys will be only with the sender and the recipients

    > Types of encryption
        > Symmetric
            > encryption is done with a key and decryption is done with the same key
            > anyone has the key can decrypt the message
            > very fast to use
        > Asymmetric
            > this includes 2 keys (public and private key)
            > messages can be encrypted only with the public key
            > messages can only be decrypted with the private key
            > much more expensive than Symmetric (but much more safer)
            > public key can be sent to anyone to send you an encrypted key
            > private key is the only key that can decrypt the message
                > no body should take the private key

            > RSA algorithms
                > an algo that is used to do the Asymmetric encryption
