Telnet
    > stands for teletype network
    > is a terminal emulation program that is used to remote access linux servers
    > is a command line tool
        > very fast (no graphics)
    > you can use the commands on the telnet to control the server
        > CRUDE files and folders 
        > start/stop services
    > other usage
        > manage and config other network devices
            > routers
            > switches
        > test ports are open on servers

    > no encryption
        > vulnerable to attacks
        > should not be used over the internet
        > not a choice for controlling old servers

    > a good alternative is SSH
        > is same as telnet but secure
