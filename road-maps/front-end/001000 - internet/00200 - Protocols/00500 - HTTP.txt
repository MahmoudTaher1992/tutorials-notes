HTTP
    > stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
    > a protocol for fetching the resources (i.e HTML pages) over the internet
    > it is a foundation for any data transfer over the internet

    > the protocol is evolved over time
    > it is an application level protocol
    > sent over TCP or over TLS-TCP or any other transport protocol

    > used to fetch
        > HTML documents
        > images
        > audio
        > video
        > strings

    > it is a client server protocol
        > a request is sent from the client (a user agent - i.e. browser) to the server
            > a user agent can be any thing 
        > the server replies with many documents
        > the browser gathers the documents to show you the result
        
        > clients and servers communicate by exchanging messages 
            > a message sent by the client is called request
            > a message sent by the server is called response

    > Client - the user agent
        > it is any tool that acts on behalf of the user
        > the browser is the one who always starts the request

        > To display a web page
            > a user writes a URL
            > the browser sends HTTP request to fetch the HTML document (which represents the web page)
            > when the browser receives the response with the HTML document it analysis its dependencies and send HTTP requests to load them
            > once everything is ready it combines everything together and displays the web page
            > when the user clicks on another link in the page the same process occurs

    > The web server
        > a machine/software that responds to the requests coming from the clients
        > the requests may be handled by multiple machines with a load balancer
        > you can setup multiple server as a software on the same machine

    > Proxies
        > Between the client and the server there are numerous amount of machines that relay the HTTP messages
        > They can be
            > Transparent
                > Don't change anything in the HTTP messages
            > Non-Transparent
                > perform actions on the HTTP messages
                    > caching
                    > logging
                    > authentication
                    > load balancing
                    > filtering

    > HTTP aspects
        > Simple
            > Human readable
        > Extensible
            > Easy to expand and perform other tasks
            > audio, video can be transferred because HTTP is extensible
        > Stateless but not session-less
            > no link between any requests
            > cookies are used to have some info about the session

    > HTTP and connections
        > a connection is maintained at the Transport Layer
            > HTTP requires reliable connection so it doesn't care which transport protocol is used as long as it is reliable
                > reliable means that the messaging can not be lost and the connection can be restored
            > Most common protocols on the internet are
                > TCP => reliable
                > UDP => not reliable
            > HTTP relies on TCP which is connection based
    
        > before a client can exchange a HTTP request with the server it must establish a TCP connection
            > it is a round trip
            > HTTP 1.0 opens a separate connection for each req/res pair => less efficient
            > HTTP 2 multi messaging over the same connection

    > What can be controlled by HTTP
        > the extensible nature of HTTP allowed for more control and functionality over the time
            > caching
            > Relaxing the origin constraint
            > authentication
        > Caching
            > can be controlled by HTTP
            > the server can instruct the proxies and the clients about what to cache and for how long
            > the client can instruct the proxies to ignore a cached document
        > Relaxing the origin constraint
            > Sometimes the browsers have constraints (i.e. CORS)
            > you can overcome this problem by attaching some headers to the HTTP response
        > authentication
