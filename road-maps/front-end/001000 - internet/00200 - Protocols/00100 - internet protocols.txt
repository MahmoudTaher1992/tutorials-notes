Internet Protocol
    > a set of rules, conventions and data structures that determines how data is transmitted between different devices on the Internet
    > it is a common language that all devices on the internet can talk and understand regardless of their architecture and design
    
    > OSI model
        > stands for Open Systems Interconnection model
        > Considered the primary architectural model for internet communications
        > OSI is a Framework
        > the majority of network protocols are structurally based on the OSI model
        > It splits the communication process into 7 layers (ordered)
            > Application
            > Presentation
            > Session
            > Transport
            > Network
            > Data-Link
            > Physical

    > Lots of hardware and software work together to move the data through the layers to be transmitted to another devices

    > To send the data from one end to another it should pass through all layers of protocols 

    > Application layer (layer 7)
        > it has nothing to do with the user application like chrome or safari (it is just a term) 
        > It is the protocol that browsers and apps use to send requests and receive responses, this protocol lies in the Layer 1
        > Then they use the network services to send the request
            > the request contains
                > target ip address
                > target port
                > target path
                > body
                > some other data in the headers
        > The job of this layer ends with the created request as string
        > then it passes the request to next layer
        > Application layer protocols example
            > HTTP
            > HTTPs
            > FTP
            > DNS
            > DHCP
            > Telnet
            > SSH
            > POP
            > SMTP
            > SOAP
            > NFS

    > Presentation layer (layer 6)
        > Encryption/Decryption happens in this layer
        > Compression/Decompression Happens in protocols that follow this layer
        > ensures the data is in usable format
            > if it is going to the application layer it should be decrypted
            > if it is going to the session layer it should be encrypted
        > Protocols examples
            > SSL
            > TLS
    
    > Session Layer (layer 5)
        > establish sessions between users and maintains them
        > tags the request with session id
        > protocols that follow this layer create communication channels between devices
            > creates sessions and maintain them while data is being transmitted and then closes it
            > if the session is interrupted protocols will reestablish them and continue transmitting data from the last checkpoint

    > Transport layer (layer 4)
        > Breaks the request into small parts called Segments
        > adds a metadata on it with the target and source port
        > also it adds a sequence on the segments to be easily combined again
        > combines different segments together on the target
            > if any segment is missing it requests it again
            > at the end it will supply the session layer the same data that was divided as the source device
        > examples
            > TCP
            > UDP

    > Network layer (layer 3)
        > Breaks the segments into packets
        > attaches the sender and receiver ip addresses
        > involves in routing the packets correctly to the target device
        > examples
            > IP

    > Data Like (layer 2)
        > Breaks down into frames
        > attaches the sender and receiver mac address
        > establish a connection between two physical devices on the network
        > made up of two parts
            > LLC - Logical Link Control
                > Error checking
                > sync frames
            > MAC - Media Access Control
                > uses mac addresses to connect two devices
    
    > Physical layer (layer 1)
        > Changes the frames into zeros and ones
        > sends the data to the target using
            > light
            > electrical signals
            > radio waves
        > responsible of sending raw data through the physical devices between two devices on the network
