DHCP
    > stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    > is a service that runs on a server and can also run on a router
    > every device on the internet must have an ip address
    > devices can have ip address 
        > static/manual ip address
            > user is doing this step in the internet configuration options
            > a lot of work as you have to make sure that the ip-address is unique
        > dynamic ip address
            > easier by delegating this task to a computer called DHCP server
            > it assigns an auto ip address to the computer alongside with other configs such as
                > subnet mask
                > default gateway
                > DNS server
    > DHCP assigns ip addresses from its scope (start and end ip addresses)
    > it also assigns a lease (expiry date) for each ip address
        > helps make sure that the DHCP server doesn't run out of ip-addresses
        > after the lease is expired the device will send a request to the DHCP to renew the lease
        > if it didn't send the request the DHCP server will return the ip address to the pool
    > address reservation
        > ensures that specific device will always be given the same ip address
        > i.e.
            > network printers
            > routers
            > servers
