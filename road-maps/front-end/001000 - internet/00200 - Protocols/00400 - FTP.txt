FTP, SFTP, TFTP
    > protocols used for transferring files over the internet

FTP
    > stands for File Transfer Protocol
    > you can use the browser as a FTP client or a specific app (i.e. FileZella)
    > Sometimes you will require a username or password
    > not a secure protocol because the data is not encrypted while transmission
    > should be used on a limited basis
    > uses TCP => the connection is trustable

SFTP
    > stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol
    > Adds a layer of security to FTP
    > Data is encrypted using a secure shell
    > uses port 22

TFTP
    > stands for Trivial File Transfer Protocol
    > used to transfer files over local network
    > uses UDP which is a connection less protocol (not trustable)
    > doesn't provide security
