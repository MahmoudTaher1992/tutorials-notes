HTTPs
    > Stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
    > is a secure version of the HTTP protocol that uses SSL/TSL protocol (presentation layer) for encryption and authentication
    > uses 443 port instead of 80
    > makes it possible for internet users to safely transmit sensitive data over the internet as it will be encrypted
    > HTTPS adds to HTTP the following
        > Encryption
        > authentication
        > integrity

        > HTTP is designed to be clear/understandable text
        > so it is vulnerable to middle attacks
        > this is done through SSL/TSL encryption
            > Handshake
                > First the client establish a TCP connection with the server
            > Certificate check (authentication)
                > the server sends ssl/tsl certificate
                > the browser validates the certificate and gets the public key from it
            > Session key exchange
                > the client encrypts a session key (Symmetric) with the public key and sends it to the server
                > the server then decrypts the session key with the private key
            > Transmission starts (Encryption)
                > the data sent between the server and client will be encrypted/decrypted with the session key (Symmetric)
        > each document includes a digital signature that a web browser can check that no body altered the message (integrity)

    > HTTPS is a safer protocol to use while transmitting data
