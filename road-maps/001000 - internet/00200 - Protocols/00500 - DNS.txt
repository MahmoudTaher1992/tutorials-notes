DNS
    > stands for Domain Name System
    > the phone book of the internet
        > keeps track of all host names and their linked ip address
    > When you send a request the first thing happens is the client will pass a query to the dns server to get the ip address
        > it will start looking it in the cache first and if nothing is found it will be passed to the dns
    > when you buy a domain name from GoDaddy for example
        > GoDaddy will register your hostname in the dns registry
        > when any request is sent from anywhere it will be returned with the registered ip address

    > all devices on the internet communicate using their ip addresses
    > you don't have to remember the ip addresses - you can just enter the domain names instead
    > DNS service does that job of translating domain names into ip addresses
    > the DNS request is called queries
