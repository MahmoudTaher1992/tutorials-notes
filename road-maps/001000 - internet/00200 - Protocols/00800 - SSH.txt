SSH
    > stands for secure shell
    > is a communication protocol (application layer)
    > does nearly everything on the remote computer
    > traffic is encrypted
    > used mostly in the terminal/command line
    > similar to telnet (but telnet is not secure)

    > Client/Server communication
        > SSH is the client
        > You can not access any machine on the internet even if you have all the credentials (you must install and run SSH-daemon on the target machine)
        > linux come with sshd installed by default

    > Authentication methods (username + host ip address + ...)
        > password
        > private/public key pair

    > Generating keys
        > use ssh-keygen
        > create
            > private key under "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
            > public key under "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
            > public key goes to the server in the file "~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

    > Windows
        > ssh is a linux based command and it can not be used with windows
        > Putty is used with older versions of windows
        > Putty-gen is used to create the keys on windows instead of ssh-keygen
        > you can also use git-bash on windowsx
