Rendering Engine
    > displays the quested content on the browser's screen
    > can display
        > HTML
        > XML
        > images
    > can also use plugins to display
        > PDFs

    > Different browsers use different rendering engines
        > chrome & opera => blink
        > Internet Explorer => Trident
        > Firefox => Gecko
        > Safari => WebKit

    > The main flow
        > The rendering engine will get the content of the requested document from the networking layer
        > The flow
            > 1. Content tree (DOM tree)
                > the engine constructs the content tree (DOM nodes in a tree)
            > 2. Render tree 
                > the engine will parse the style data in the CSS and the style in elements
                > Styling info and visual instructions in the HTML will be used to construct the render tree
                > contains rectangles with visual attributes such as the color and dimensions 
            > 3. Layout process
                > process of giving each node the exact coordinates where it should appear on the screen
            > 4. Painting
                > Each node will be painted using the UI backend layer

            > it is a gradual process
                > the rendering engine will try to display contents to the user as soon as possible
                > some of the contents will be parsed and displayed while the process continues with the rest of the contents

            > each rendering engine will have it's own flow of rendering but they are somehow similar
