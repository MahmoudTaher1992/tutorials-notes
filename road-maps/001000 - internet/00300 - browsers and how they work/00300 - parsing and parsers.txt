Parsing and parsers
    > Parsing
        > is a significant process within the rendering engine
        > Parsing a document means translating it to a structure the code can use
        > the result of parsing is usually a tree of nodes that represent the structure of the document

        > every format you can parse must have a deterministic grammar consisting of vocabulary and syntax rules
            > Human languages are not such formats and that's why it can not be parsed using normal parsers
        
        > Parsing can be separated into 2 sub processes (Lexical analysis and Syntax analysis)
            > Lexical analysis
                > the process of breaking the input into tokens
                    > Token => is the language vocabulary (like words in human languages)
            > Syntax analysis
                > is applying the language syntax rules

        > Parsers usually divide the work between two components
            > Lexer (Tokenizer)
                > responsible for breaking the input into valid tokens
            > Parser
                > responsible for constructing the parse tree by analyzing the document structure according to the language syntax rules

        > Translation
            > In many cases the parse tree is not the final product
            > the parsed document is translated into another format before being used
            > Compilers
                > the compilers first parses the code into a document
                > then it translates it into machine code
