    > there are multiple ways to store data in the FEs
        > local storage
        > session storage
        > IndexedDB
        > Web SQL
        > Cookies
    
    > local storage
        > stores the data in key-value pairs
        > the values are stored as strings only
        > there are a 5mb limit for each value
        > it is stored even after the browser is closed

    > session storage
        > similar to local storage
        > it loses the data once the browser is closed

    > IndexDB
        > the schema is up to you
        > the data is indexed
        > no limitation on the size
        > it is slower that local/session storage

    > Web SQL
        > a depreciated API for security and extendability reasons
        > used to store the data in any way you like because it uses SQLLite under the hood
        > you can deal with the data in SQL statements

    > Cookies
        > limited size
        > data is stored in key-value pairs
        > any data in the cookies will be added to all the requests sent to the BEs
