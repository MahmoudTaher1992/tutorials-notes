Basic cryptography
    > securing the web relies on cryptography (the same way used for communication security for centuries)
    > communications security is based on cryptography
        > cryptography relies on mathematics

    > using cryptography
        > cryptography word is derived from the greek words secret writing
        > it is the task of keeping the information secret
        > cryptography is also used to
            > keeping secrets
                > by encrypting the message so that only the intended recipient can read it after decrypting it
            > proving identity
                > knowing that the message is from the intended sender
            > verifying information
                > making sure that the message has not been altered

                > it is done by a cryptographic function called the hash function
                    > it gives a summary of the message
                    > if the message is altered the hash function result will change and the receiver will know that the message is altered

    > types of cryptography
        > one essential element of cryptography is using a secret codes (Keys) that only the sender and the receiver know
        > cryptography falls into two categories
            > secret key cryptography
                > also known as symmetric key cryptography
                > the same key is used for encryption and decryption

            > public key cryptography
                > overcome the limitations of secret key cryptography (the key exchange security problem)
                > also known as asymmetric key cryptography
                > there are 2 keys instead of one duplicated key
                    > public key
                        > used for encryption
                        > can be shared with anyone, doesn't need to be kept secret
                    > private key
                        > used for decryption
                        > must be kept secret

                    > some algorithms allow the public key to decrypted the message encrypted by the private key

                    > this feature can be used to prove identity
                        > if the client decrypts a well known message, then the server is the sender because he is the only one with the private key
                    > this feature can be used to provide a digital signature 
                        > we can know that the encrypted message is only from the server, thus it is a signature

                    > some public keys algorithms are used for digital signing only

            > symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography
                > symmetric key cryptography is faster than asymmetric key cryptography
                > asymmetric key cryptography is used to exchange the symmetric key
                    > the symmetric key is created by the client, encrypted by the public key and sent to the receiver
                    > the receiver decrypts the symmetric key using the private key
                    > the symmetric key is used to exchange the messages
