Postmortem Culture
    > introduction
        > incidents and outages are inevitable
        > unless there is a process to learn from them, they will be repeated
        > if no proper fixes and follow-up actions are taken, the same incident may happen again and may cascade into a larger outage
        > postmortems are an essential tool for SRE

        > postmortem 
            > is a written record of an incident
            > its impact, 
            > the actions taken to mitigate or resolve it
            > the root cause(s)
            > and the follow-up actions to prevent the incident from recurring

    > Googleâ€™s Postmortem Philosophy
        > the primary goal of postmortems
            > ensure the incident is documented
            > all causes are understood
            > preventive actions are put to reduce a recurrence
