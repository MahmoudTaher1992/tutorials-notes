Postmortem Culture
    > introduction
        > incidents and outages are inevitable
        > unless there is a process to learn from them, they will be repeated
        > if no proper fixes and follow-up actions are taken, the same incident may happen again and may cascade into a larger outage
        > postmortems are an essential tool for SRE

        > postmortem 
            > is a written record of an incident
            > its impact, 
            > the actions taken to mitigate or resolve it
            > the root cause(s)
            > and the follow-up actions to prevent the incident from recurring

    > Googleâ€™s Postmortem Philosophy
        > the primary goal of postmortems
            > ensure the incident is documented
            > all causes are understood
            > preventive actions are put to reduce a recurrence
        > Postmortems 
            > are expected after any significant undesirable event
            > not punishment, it is a learning opportunity for the entire company.
            > it is costly, so it must be done when required
            > an opportunity to raise the reliability of the system and fix it's weaknesses

            > Postmortems criteria (when to conduct one)
                > depends on the team
                > must be defined to reduce conflicts
                > i.e.
                    > user visible downtime
                    > data loss
                    > on call engineer intervention (rollback, ...)
                    > monitoring failure (you will know it if an incident is discovered manually)
                    > stakeholder request

            > blameless tenet
                > focus on the causes
                > don't blame an individual/team
                > assume everyone involved is well-intentioned
                > if you blame someone, they will not be honest and they will the issues in fear of punishment
                    > you will not learn from the incident

                > every mistake is an opportunity to strength the system
                > effective plans can be put in place

                > this culture originated in industries where errors are fatal
                    > i.e.
                        > aviation
                        > healthcare

                > the postmortem should be written in a blameless format
                    > i.e.
                        > Do write "the system failed to handle the load"
                        > Don't write "the engineer failed to handle the load"

    > Collaborate and share knowledge
        > postmortems includes collaboration and sharing at every stage
        > the tool you use should have collaboration features
            > real time collaboration
            > open commenting/annotation system
            > Notification system (i.e. email, ...)

        > review 
            > formal review is a requirement to postmortem process
            > an un reviewed postmortem is not considered a postmortem
            > first a draft is created
            > a group of seniors review it
                > review criteria   
                    > was the incident data collected for posterity?
                    > are the impact assessments complete?
                    > was the root causes sufficiently deep?
                    > is the action plan appropriate?
                    > are the bug issues created with right priority?
                    > did we share the outcome with the right people?

        > publications
            > after reviewing stage
            > postmortems are shared on a wider scale via notification medium (email, ...)
            > the goal is to share the knowledge and the lessons learned with the widest possible audience

        > Archiving
            > all postmortems should be saved for the future

    > postmortem template
        > please check it at the book appendix

    > introducing postmortem culture
        > easier said than done
        > it requires continuous cultivation and reinforcement
            > it can be reinforced by involving the management in the process
        
        > events that help 
            > Postmortem of the month
                > monthly
                > well-written postmortem is shared with the entire organization

            > slack group
                > discussions on the postmortems

            > postmortem reading club
                > a group that discuss postmortems
                > postmortems may be months/years old

            > Wheel of Misfortune
                > a simulation of the roles and their jobs in an incident

            > you may come up with your own events
                > postmortem summary meeting
                    > although it is some kind of publication but it is a good way to raise the postmortem culture

        > resistance
            > one of the questions that may arise is that `is it worth the time?`

            > how to face it
                > imagine a company without postmortems ?!!!
                > look at the old postmortems and see how they benefited the company
                > encourage seniors to talk about it's importance
                > encourage the team by rewarding effective postmortems and announce it to the team and the company

        > pros of cultivating a postmortem culture
            > increased reliability
            > the team efficiency will increase
            > ongoing improvements
