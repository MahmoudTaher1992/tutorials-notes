Sensing and Separation
    > there are 2 reasons to break the dependencies for testing
        > Sensing
            > to gain the ability to observe the results of the system under test
            > you don't have control over the dependencies, so you don't know what is happening with it 
        > Separation
            > to make the code testable

    > Faking collaborators
        > putting another mock object in place of the real object
            > the new mock will have less or no dependencies
            > it will be easy to sense the changes through that object

        > the two sides of fake objects
            > the test will see the fake object as a real object
            > the test will see the fake object as a fake object
                > to access methods of the fake object
