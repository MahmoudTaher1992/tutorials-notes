The seam model
    > introduction
        > it is common that lots of existing codebase can not be tested easily
        > the easiest way to make a testable app
            > write tests as you develop
            > spend time trying to design the codebase for testability

    > seams
        > when you start testing, you will have to pull out classes for testing
        > to do that you will have to break dependencies
        > no matter how good the code is designed, you will have to do that
        
        > seam
            > a place where you can alter behavior in your program without editing in that place

        > with the seam view, it helps you to see the opportunities in the codebase where you can selectively exclude the dependencies at test time

        > Enabling points
            > the places where you can make the decision to use one behavior or another
            > every seam has an enabling point

    > seam types
        > preprocessing seams
            > you can preprocessing conditional statements to change the behavior of dependencies
                > i.e.
                    > if (isTest) {
                        db = new MockDatabase();
                    } else {
                        db = new Database();
                    }
                > the enabling point is the isTest variable

            > learning more about the compilation process will reveal lots of seams to you

        > Link Seams
            > In most programming languages, a link is used to connect different parts of code together
            > the compiler resolves the link and replace it with it's code
            > you can configure the compiler to use a different link, and here is the link seams

            > 
                > seam
                    > is the initialization of the imported code
                > enabling point
                    > is the import statement

        > Object Seams
            > use object oriented programming to create seams
            > supply a mock object that share the same interface with the real one

    > try not to use preprocessing seams and Link Seams, until you can not do it with object seam
