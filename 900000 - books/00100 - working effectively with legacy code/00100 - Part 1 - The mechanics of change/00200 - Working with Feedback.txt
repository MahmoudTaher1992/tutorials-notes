            > plan the changes you want to make

            > poke around to see if anything else broke

        > the care increases as the task is more sensitive

        > Safe change
            > the care will not ensure safety of the change

            > work with a safety net when we add new changes in the code
            > the net will catch all bad changes from leaking into the codebase
            > the net is tests

        > you still have to move carefully
        > you will get a feedback about the changes you made
