vendor prefix
    > when there is a new feature added to the css it is not implemented directly in the browsers
        > they use a prefix props instead for some experimental time and then it is moved to production without prefixes

    > you have to check for the compatibility of the prop before using it 
        > there are websites that help you with that
            > caniuse
            > .. etc

    > you can also use task runner to automatically add that for you
        > there is a webpack plugin for that as well
