units
    > CSS has several different units for expressing a length
    > length units are of 2 types
        > absolute
        > relative
    > absolute
        > fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size
        > not recommended
        > i.e.
            > cm
            > mm
            > pt
            > px
            > in
            > pc
    > relative
        > specify a length relative to another length property
        > i.e.
            > em
            > ex
            > %
            > etc
