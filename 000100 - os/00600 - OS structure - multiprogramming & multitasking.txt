Multiprogramming & Multitasking
    > operating systems vary internally from each other but they all must apply
        > Multiprogramming
        > time sharing / multitasking

    > Multiprogramming systems
        > a single user can not keep the CPU busy all the time (he must release it to be efficient)
        > it increases the efficiency of the CPU by organizing the jobs so that the CPU has something to do
        > the jobs are tasks to be done by the CPU
        > the jobs are created and added to the job pool
        > the jobs are moved from the pool to fill the available memory
        > the the os handles the jobs in the memory efficiently
            > if the job is using something other than the CPU (i.e. I/O devices)
            > it lets other loaded jobs use the CPU instead of waiting 
            > the CPU will always have something to do (efficiency) 

        > provide an environment in which the resources are used efficiently
        > they don't let the user interact with the computer system

    > time sharing / multitasking
        > the CPU executes multiple jobs by switching between them
        > switching is done so quickly in a way it allows the user to interact with each program
        > provides a direct communication between the user and the system
        > allows many users share the computer between them

    > CPU scheduling is used to organize the work done by the CPU
    > a process is a program loaded in the memory to be executed by the CPU
