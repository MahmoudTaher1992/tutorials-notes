Inter-process communication (IPC)
    > processes in the system may be
        > independent
            > can not be affected by other processes in the system
        > cooperating
            > can be affected by other processes
            > share the same data
            > work together to achieve a big task quickly, AKA speedup
            > modularity

    > IPC is required by the cooperating processes to exchange data and information
    > IPC communication types
        > shared memory
            > a region of the memory is shared by multiple process
            > processes can read and write the data to the shared memory
        > message passing
            > messages exchanged between the processes
            > the os takes care of delivering the message to the target process

    > Shared memory systems
        > shared memory is established between the cooperating processes
        > each process that wills to enter the group of cooperating processes must share it's memory address
        > os will prevent process from accessing their memory unless they approve

        > i.e. (producer consumer problem)
            > a problem when a process is creating a output that id used by another process
            > some times the consumer process takes incomplete segment of the data
            > a solution is a shared memory in which a buffer of items are filled by the producer and consumed by the consumer
            > the must work in sync so that they don't be blocked or produce corrupted outputs

        > Buffers types
            > Unbounded buffer
                > no limit on the size of the buffer
                > the producer is not limited
                > the consumer may wait if the buffer is empty

            > Bounded buffer
                > their is a specific size of the buffer
                > the producer may wait if the buffer it full
                > the consumer may wait if the buffer is empty
