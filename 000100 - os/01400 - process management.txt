    > process
        > process is a program in execution, before that it is a normal program.
        > old computers supports one process at a time

    > threads
        > a unit of execution within a process
        > a process can have from one thread to multiple threads
    
    > you can view the processes running on your os at the task manager
    > you can also see the threads within each process

    > process states
        > New
            > the process is being created

        > Ready
            > the process is waiting to be assigned to a processor

        > running
            > instructions are being executed

        > waiting
            > is waiting for some event to occur (I/O operation for example)

        > terminated
            > is finished execution

    > process control block
        > is a block that contains an information about the process

    > process scheduling
        > the aim of multiprogramming/time sharing
            > have some process run at all the time
            > maximize CPU utilization
            > switch the CPU over all the process so quickly that each program looks like it is continuously running

        > what does these things is the process schedular
            > it priorities the process
            > it makes all of them ass over the CPU for some time
            > one will be executed, the rest will have to wait there round

        > scheduling queues
            > queues of process that are waiting to be executed
            > types
                > job queue
                    > consists of all processors in the system
                > ready queue
                    > consists of all processors in the main memory that are ready and waits to be executed

    > context switch
        > interrupts cause the OS to stop the CPU's current task and do another task, it happens a lot.
        > When it happens, the system saves the data of the process in something called context.
        > when the CPU is free againØŒ it takes back the stopped process with it's context and resumes it.
        > the context is stored in the Process Control Block (PCB) of the process

        > context switch 
            > is the action by which the context is saved when the process stops, and restored when the process resumes
            > context switch time is a pure overhead because the system does nothing while the switch occurs.
