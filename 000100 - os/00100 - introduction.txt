introduction
    > os
        > stands for operating system
        > is a program that manages the computer hardware
        > acts as a medium between the user and the computer hardware

    > os examples
        > windows
        > linux
        > ubuntu
        > mac os
        > ios
        > android

    > levels (up to down)
        > system/applications programs
            > system softwares
                > softwares that directly control the hardware
            > application softwares
                > softwares used by users to perform tasks 
                > i.e.
                    > office
                    > browsers
                    > compilers
                    > editors
        > operating system
        > hardware
            > CPU
            > memory (RAMs, ROMs)
            > I/O devices

    > for the application softwares to work they have to tell the hardware what to do
        > i.e.
            > load the app into the memory
            > open the app
            > write some text
        > this communication is done through binary code
        > it is very hard to develop some apps like that
        > here comes the function of the OS
        > OS exposes functions that can be used by the software app developers to control the hardware
        
    > Some types of OSs
        > Batch OS
        > Time sharing OS
        > Distributed OS
        > Network OS
        > Real time OS
        > Multi programming/processing/tasking OS

    > Functions of OSs
        > acts as an interface between User and Hardware
        > allocation of resources
        > management of memory, security, ... etc

    > Goals of OS
        > convenience
            > makes it easy for users to communicates with hardware
        > efficiency
            > who gets what resources for how long
            > resources management
        > Both
