                > acts as the interface between the user applications and the file system itself

            > Virtual File System
                > enables the concurrent operation of multiple instances of physical file systems
                > provides a common interface for all file systems
            > Physical File System
                > responsible for the tangible management and storage of physical memory blocks on the disk
                > handles the low-level details of storing and retrieving data
                > interacts directly with the hardware components

    > Mounts
        > mounting in Linux refers to the process that allows the operating system to access data stored on underlying storage devices, such as hard drives or SSDs
        > This process attaches a filesystem (available on some storage medium) to a specific directory (also known as a mount point) in the Linux directory tree

        > mount command
            > used for mounting filesystems
            > When a specific filesystem is ‘mounted’ at a particular directory, the system can begin reading data from the device and interpreting it according to the filesystem’s rules.

    > Adding disks
        > when adding new disks to a Linux system, you need to prepare them first before you can use them:
            > Partition the disk
            > creating the filesystem on the partition
            > mounting the filesystem

        > commands
            > lsblk
                > list all block devices (disk and partitions)
            > fdisk
                > create a new partition on a disk
            > mkfs.ext4
                > create a new filesystem on a partition
            > mount
                > mount the filesystem to a directory

    > swap
        > a space on a disk that is used when the amount of physical RAM memory is full
        > If the system needs more memory resources and the physical memory is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space.
        > Swap space is a portion of a hard disk drive (HDD) that is used for virtual memory
        > this will come with low performance as the disk is slower than the RAM
        > swap can live in a partition or a file

        > LVM
            > Logical Volume Manager
            > a framework of managing logical volumes, or filesystems, that is much more advanced than the traditional method of partitioning a disk into one or more segments
