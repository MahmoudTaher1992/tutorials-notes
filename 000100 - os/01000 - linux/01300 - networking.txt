Networking
    > TCP/IP
        > a fundamental framework for computer networking
        > stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
        > the core protocols of the Internet
        > defines how data is transmitted over networks, ensuring reliable communication between devices

        > consists of four layers
            > Application
            > Transport
            > Internet
            > Link

        > designed and developed in the department of defense, USA
        
        > TCP/IP function
            > transfer the data from one device to another
            > ensuring the reliability and the integrity of the data
            > it divides the data into packets at the source and reassembles them at the destination

        > TCP and IP protocols
            > TCP is responsible breaking, assembling the data and making sure it is delivered correctly
            > IP is responsible for routing the data packets across the network to the correct destination

    > Subnetting
        > the proses of dividing a network into smaller networks, known as subnets
