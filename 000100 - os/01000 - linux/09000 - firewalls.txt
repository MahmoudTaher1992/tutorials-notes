        > ufw
        > firewalld

    > an application that inspects and filters network traffic
    
    > features
        > enable/disable the firewall itself
        > allow or block traffic based on
            > the target port
                > deny all traffic to port 2323
                > the port can be specified by the service name
                    > i.e.
                        > sudo ufw allow ssh
            > the source IP
                > allow/block traffic from one/many ips only

    > all the ports will be open by default, if a service is listening on it
        > i.e.
            > port 22/tcp is closed by default, it refuses the connection because no service is listening on it
            > port 22/tcp is open if ssh.service is running and listening on it
            > port 22/tcp is closed if ssh.service is stopped
            > port 22/tcp is open if ssh.service is running and listening on it
            > port 22/tcp is closed if ufw is enabled and there is no rule to allow it
            > port 22/tcp is open if ufw is enabled and there is a rule to allow it

    > a port will accept connections if the firewall allow traffic to it and there is a service listening on it
