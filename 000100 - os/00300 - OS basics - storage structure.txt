Storage structure
    > storage examples hierarchy
        > volatile (data is lost if power is removed)
            > registers
            > cache
            > main memory

        > non-volatile (data is not lost if power is removed)
            > electronic disk
            > magnetic disk
            > optical disk
            > magnetic tapes

    > when you go down the hierarchy
        > the price goes down
        > the storage increases
        > access time increases

    > when you have more of the main memory the speed of the computer increases
