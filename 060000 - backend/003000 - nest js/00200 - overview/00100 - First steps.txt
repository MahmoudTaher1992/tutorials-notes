    > main.js
        > the entry point to the app
        > NestFactory.create() is used to build a nest app that implements INestApplication
        > INestApplication exposes multiple methods
            > listen
                > start up a HTTP listener, lets the app await inbound HTTP requests

    > Nest is able to work with any HTTP framework, once an adapter is created
        > there are 2 frameworks that are supported out of the box
            > express
                > via platform-express
            > fastify 

            > each frame work will export its own app interface
                > express
                    > NestExpressApplication
                > fastify
                    > NestFastifyApplication   

                > you don't need to specify the type to NestFactory.create(), unless you want to access underlying platform API
