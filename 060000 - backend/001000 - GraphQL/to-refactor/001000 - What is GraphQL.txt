What is GraphQL
    REST ful cons
        Too many URLs > as the app grows urls numbers increases dramatically

        Too many Requests > when trying to fetch heavily nested data you will end up sending lots of HTTP requests

        Over fetching > you will fetch a full company data when you only need the name

    GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a 
    type system you define for your data

    It solves the cons mentioned above

    not tied to specific database or storage engine > you can fetch data from anywhere
