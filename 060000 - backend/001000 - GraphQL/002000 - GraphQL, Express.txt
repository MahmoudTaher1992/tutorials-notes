GraphQL, Express
    GraphQL exports as a middleware function that can be used in express
        i.e.
            import  {graphqlHTTP} from "express-graphql";

            export const expressGraphQLMiddleware = graphqlHTTP({
                graphiql: true,
                schema: schema
            })

            app.use("/graph-ql", expressGraphQLMiddleware)

    GraphQL takes care of its initialization > just pass to it the schema and it will do the rest
