Security - CORS
    > CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
        > it is an HTTP-header-based protocol that enables a server to dictate which origins can access its resources
        > in another way your server can specify which websites can talk to it on which HTTP method

    > Why use CORS ?
        > CORS error arise when you try to send an API call from a client to a server (on different host/domain)

        > background context
            > internet users should be careful when installing software on their devices (sites should be trusted)
            > when it comes to internet browsing, all the time lots of data is loaded from different servers, so the risk is much more higher
            > we should be careful from the users while they are calling our server (while they are visiting another websites)
            > Browser's security mechanisms (CORS, SOP, ...etc) adds a protection by
                > specifying which browsers' origins can request resources from the server
                > origin is
                    > protocol + domain + port
            > SOP
                > stands for Same Origin Policy
                > restricts scripts from one origin from accessing resources from another origin
                > no one else outside the origin can access resources
