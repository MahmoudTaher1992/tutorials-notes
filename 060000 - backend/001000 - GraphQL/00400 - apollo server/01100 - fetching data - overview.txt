Fetching data - overview
    > you can fetch data from any where because it is a node app
    > it is recommended that you create a datasource file for each data source
        > you can configure it to use data loaders for caching and batching

    > Batching and caching
        > it is very important to add this functionality to your data sources to avoid N+1 query problem
        
        > N+1 query problem
            > graphQl executes a separate resolver function for every field whereas REST has one resolver per end point
            > if you fetch books with authors
                > first you will fetch the list of books => 1
                > for each book graphQL will fetch the author in a separate fetch => N times

            > we need to test weather the graphql batches the database queries to the BE in the N times or not
                > it is very hard to imagine that dataloader gets inside the resolvers to batch the requests
