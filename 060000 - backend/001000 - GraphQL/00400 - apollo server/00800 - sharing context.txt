Sharing context
    > is a sharable object among all resolvers and plugins
    > resolvers should not change the context to ensure consistency among all other resolvers
    > i.e.
        > data loaders
        > connectors
        > authentication info

    > context creation function
        > a context creation function is passed to the server for it to create a contextValue for each request
        > it runs once for each request
        > it can return a promise so that you do all async tasks
            > i.e.
                > wait for establishing db connection

        > throwing an error
            > you can throw a normal error and a 500 response will be sent
            > or you can throw a GraphQLError to customize the response
