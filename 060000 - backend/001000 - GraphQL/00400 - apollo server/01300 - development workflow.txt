Development workflow
    > Build and run queries
        > apollo sandbox is a GUI tool that used to query the apollo-server
        > most likely it is used in the development mode
        > by default apollo-server disables introspection in production
            > apollo-sandbox won't work 
            > you can customize that
        > changing the landing page
            > it is totally customizable
                > configure the default landing page
                > serve graphql playground
                > serve a custom page
                > disable the landing page totally

    > Request format
        > the graphql client (i.e. apollo-client) takes care of formatting the request to match the graphql server's expectation 
        > apollo-server accepts the queries and mutations in a POST request
            > queries alone can also be accepted in GET request

            > POST requests
                > should have a json body with
                    > variables
                    > extensions
                    > query
                    > operationName
                        > specifies which operation to run if the query parameter has multiple operations
