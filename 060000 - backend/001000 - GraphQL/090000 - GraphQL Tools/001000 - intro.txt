GraphQL Tools
    GraphQL Tools is a set of npm packages(@graphql-tools/*) 
    and an opinionated structure for how to build a GraphQL schema and resolvers in JavaScript,
    following the GraphQL-first development workflow.

    The GraphQL-first philosophy
        the GraphQL schema is the first thing you design, and acts as the contract between your frontend and backend

        the best way to architect a JavaScript GraphQL API codebase (Facebook's direction about the best way to use GraphQL)
            Use the GraphQL schema language

            Separate business logic from the schema
                This means that your actual business logic, permissions, and other concerns should not 
                be part of your GraphQL schema

                For large apps, GraphQL server code should be splitted into 4 components: 
                    Schema, 
                    Resolvers, 
                    Models,
                    Connectors

            Use standard libraries for auth and other special concerns
                Every server framework already has a wealth of technologies for auth, file uploads, and more (don't reinvent things)
