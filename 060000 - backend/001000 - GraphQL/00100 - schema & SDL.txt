schema
    > is a contract between the server and the client
    > defines what a GraphQL API can and can't do and how clients can request or change data
    > describes the shape of your available data

    > consists of
        > object types
        > relations between them
        > how to manipulate data
        > root query
            > the main entrance to the graph

    > is a collection of object-types that contain fields
        > each field is of a scalar-type or and object-type
            > scalar-types
                > INT

    > stands for Schema Definition Language
    > A language used to declare the graphql design

    > object type is declared as follows
        type Person {
            id: ID!
            name: STRING!
            age: INT
            friends: [Person]!
        }
        > type name is better to be in PascalCase
        > fields are declared by camelCase
        > fields are not separated by commas
        > ! is added for non-nullable fields
        > in this case `age` is nullable

        > you can add a one-line and multi-line comments as follows
