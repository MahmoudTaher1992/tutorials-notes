        > codes that represent characters
        > for the data to be transmitted over the internet it needs to be encoded
            > encoding means changing the data from an un-transmittable format into a transmittable operation
        > there are multiple character sets that were evolved over time
            > i.e.
                > ASCII
                > ANSI
                > ISO-8859-1 
                > UTF-8
        > UTF-8 is the default character set for html5
        > You have to tell the browser which character set to use while decoding the data
            > by supplying it through meta element in head
                > <meta charset='utf-8' />
