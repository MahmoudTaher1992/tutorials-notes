Please describe your expertise as senior front-end engineer (Focus React.js)
    I worked on big products with high quality code standards that 
    benifited the companies in decreasing the cost of development and maintenance

    scalability, testability and maintainability of the apps i wrote were approached using
        MVVM architecture design patterns

        Implementation of dependency inversion principle “ioc” using inversify.js library as a dependency injector 
        (The app is highly testable, extendable and maintainable aka loosely coupled)

        Implementation of open/closed principle (Pages are added by supplying their models and references)

        Most of the code i wrote is created using TDD practice (Most of the features are unit tested with jest)

    reusable components 
        tested it with jest
        designed it with storybook
        styled it with styled-components library


    liberaries
        global state
            redux

        strongly typed langauge to decrease the number of errors
            Typescript

        charts
            i used d3.js library to create the charts 

        internationalization
