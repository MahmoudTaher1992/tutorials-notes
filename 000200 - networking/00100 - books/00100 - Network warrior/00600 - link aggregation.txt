Link aggregation
    > method used in networking to combine multiple network connections in parallel to increase throughput and provide redundancy in case one of the links fails
    > pros
        > increased throughput
        > redundancy
            > if one link fails, the other links will continue to work
        > load balancing
    > this needs a setup in the network switch to support link aggregation
