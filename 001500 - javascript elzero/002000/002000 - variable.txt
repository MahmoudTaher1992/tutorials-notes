Variable
    variable is a container that has a name and a value

    to create a variable (this process is called declare a variable)
        let name;

    to declare and initialize a variable use:
        let name = "taher";

    to change the value of the variable use:
        name = "omar";

    you can declare variables using (let/var)

    javascript is a dynamically typed language
        you don't state the type of the variable

        you can reassign the value with diffrent type than the previous value

    variable name is an identifier
        identifier rules
            spaces are not allowed in the middle

            can not start w. number

            dollar signs are allowed

            espicial chars are not allowed

            identifiers are case sensitive => user is not User

            some keywords are reserved i.e. (var, let, number ,.. etc)

            it is recommended use camelCase in identifiers => other naming styles (kebab-case, snake_case)
