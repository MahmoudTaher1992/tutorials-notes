Profiler API
    The Profiler measures how often a React application renders and what the 
    “cost” of rendering is. 

    Its purpose is to measure which parts of app is slow and try to optimize it

    It is disables in the production build

        render(
            <App>
                <Profiler id="Panel" onRender={callback}>
                    <Panel {...props}>
                    <Profiler id="Content" onRender={callback}>
                        <Content {...props} />
                    </Profiler>
                    <Profiler id="PreviewPane" onRender={callback}>
                        <PreviewPane {...props} />
                    </Profiler>
                    </Panel>
                </Profiler>
