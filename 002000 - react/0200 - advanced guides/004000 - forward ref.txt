Forwarding Refs
    I don’t know why we should use React.forwardRef instead of custom prop, but from my experience i should stick with
    the way the documentation says

    React components hide their implementation details, including their rendered output

    Highly usable components might need to pass a ref to inner dom element and provide it to parent components
        managing focus, 
        selection,
        animations.

    Ref forwarding is an opt-in feature that lets some components take a ref they receive, and pass it further down
     (in other words, “forward” it) to a child.

    Example
        const FancyButton = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
            <button ref={ref} className="FancyButton">
                {props.children}
            </button>
        ));

        // You can now get a ref directly to the DOM button:
        const ref = React.createRef();
        <FancyButton ref={ref}>Click me!</FancyButton>;

    HOC
        Refs Aren’t Passed Through
