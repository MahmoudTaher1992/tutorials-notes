Render Props
    refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.

    Use Render Props for Cross-Cutting Concerns
        the example provided in the docs says that if you want to share a feature of detecting the mouse location
        for other components > you shoud use render prop
        
        i.e.
            MousePositionTracker component tracks x, y and updates state w. it

        You should put this logic inside a component and add a prop to it named "render" (or any other name)
        inside which you will use a function that takes mousePosition as prop

        The parent component (MousePositionTracker) will update mouse position and render new child component using
        render method

        You can use children prop to pass the function

    React.PureComponent
        Has a problem implementing this feature
