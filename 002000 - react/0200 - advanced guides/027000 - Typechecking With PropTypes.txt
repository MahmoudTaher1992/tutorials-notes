Typechecking With PropTypes
    As your app grows, you can catch a lot of bugs with typechecking

    i.e.
        Greeting.propTypes = {
            name: PropTypes.string
        };

    When an invalid value is provided for a prop, a warning will be shown in the JavaScript console

    For performance reasons, propTypes is only checked in development mode.

    You can check that only on child is passed to component !!

    You can set Default Prop Values

    Function Components have a special way to defined prop type
