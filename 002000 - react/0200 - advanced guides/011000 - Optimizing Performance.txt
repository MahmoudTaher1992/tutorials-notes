Optimizing Performance
    React uses several clever techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations 
    required to update the UI.

    but there are several other ways you can speed up your React application.

    Use the Production Build
        if you are testing performance > run the app in production mode

        development mode includes many helpful warnings > make react larger and slower

        you can use react devtools to know weather u are in production mode or development mode

    There are instructions to minify the build using bundlers

    Use profiling components with devtools profiler

    Visualize long lists
        long lists of data (hundreds or thousands of rows) > technique known as â€œwindowing"

        react-window and react-virtualized are popular windowing libraries

    Avoid Reconciliation
        React builds and maintains React elements, when rerenders the react compares new 
        elements with older elements
        if there are changes > Dom updates

        Even though this saved time but if you want more savings > go with shouldComponentUpdate
        if return false all the sub components will not rerenders

        consider using PureComponents

    shouldComponentUpdate In Action
        there is an image the describes the Reconciliation as there

        PureComponents will do shallow comparison for you to ignore writing logic 4 
        shouldComponentUpdate

        If you need deep comparison PureComponents will not detect the change and updates 
        will not happen
            Solution > update props and state immutably > the PureComponents will do ref check 
            and will catch the change
