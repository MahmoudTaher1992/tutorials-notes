React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces

Difference between library and Framework >
    KeyDifference:
        The key difference between a library and a framework is “Inversion of Control”. When you call a method from a library, 
        you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you.
    Library: 
        It is just a collection of routines (functional programming) or class definitions(object oriented programming). 
        The reason behind is simply code reuse, i.e. get the code that has already been written by other developers
    Framework:
        In framework, all the control flow is already there, and there are a bunch of predefined white spots that we 
        should fill out with our code. A framework is normally more complex. 
        It defines a skeleton where the application defines its own features to fill out the skeleton

React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need.
