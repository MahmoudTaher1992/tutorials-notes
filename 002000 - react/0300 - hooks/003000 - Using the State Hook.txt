Using the State Hook
    > What’s a Hook?
        > A hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features.
        > useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

    > Declaring a State Variable
        > const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        > count is the value of the state, setCount is used to update the value of the state
        > 0 is the initial value of the state
        > you can have many states as you want
        > the syntax uses javascript "Array destructuring" to get the state and the setState method
        > you can use it without this
        > the first time count will be 0 > when using setCount(10) > it will cause rerender > new count will be 10
        > you can have an object as a state
