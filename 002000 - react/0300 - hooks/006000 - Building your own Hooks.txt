Building Your Own Hooks
    > A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks
    > a custom Hook doesn’t need to have a specific signature. We can decide what it takes as arguments, 
    and what, if anything, it should return

    > the hook name must start with "use"
    > the output of one hook can be used in another preceding hook 
    > Try to resist adding abstraction too early
