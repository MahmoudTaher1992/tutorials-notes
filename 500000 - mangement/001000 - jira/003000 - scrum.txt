Scrum
    > A framework that implements that agile principles
    > Scrum 
        > encourages teams to learn through experiences 
        > self organize while working on a problem
        > look at the wins/losses to continuously improve
    > It can work with all kinds of teams not only development teams (that's why it is popular)

    > Scrum
        > is a framework not a principles set
        > describes a set of (staff that help teams structure and manage their work) 
            > meetings
            > tools
            > roles
        > is heuristic and it agrees with the fact that the team doesn't know everything from the beginning 
          but will evolve through experience
        > scrum is structured so that it helps teams to adapt naturally to the changes 
          in the conditions and users requirements
        > it is not entirely rigid
            > Clear communication, transparency and a dedication to continuous improvements 
              should be the center of any framework and the rest is up to the team

    > Scrum artifacts
        > Artifacts is something made by a human (tool) tht solves a problem
        > In scrum there are 3
            > Product Backlog
            > Sprint Backlog
            > Increment

		> Product Backlog
			> list of work to be done
			> maintained by product owner/manager
			> acts as input for sprint Backlog
			> constantly revisited, re-prioritized and maintained by the Product Owner
				> because when the requirements change the backlog changes

		> Sprint Backlog
			> list of tickets/issues/bugs selected by devs to be implemented in the sprint
			> Before each sprint > the team decides which items will be added to the sprint backlog
			> it flexible and can be change during the sprint
			> but the sprint goal can not be changed

		> Increment
			> the usable end product of the sprint
			> will be showed in the end-of-sprint demo/meeting
			> has lots of synonyms (each team uses his own term !!)
				> Done
				> Milestone
				> Sprint goal
				> Full version
				> Shipped Epic

		> You should be open to have variations in the artifacts
			> You should deal with the framework with agility
				> continuous improvements
			> This is a part of agile (be flexible)
	
	> Scrum ceremonies/events
		> One of the main components of the scrum framework
		> Set of meetings that are done on a regular basis (not a must)
			> Organize the backlog
			> Sprint planning
			> Sprint
			> Daily scrum/standup
			> Sprint review
			> Sprint Retrospective

		> Organize the backlog
			> known as backlog grooming
			> Products owner responsibility
				> Note: One of the product owner work is to constantly look at the market/customer feedback
				  in order to drive the product towards the product version
			> Keeps up with the customer/market needs to re prioritize and clean the product backlog
		
		> Sprint Planning
			> the meeting is lead by scrum master
			> they agree on the sprint goal
			> the entire team should attend and participate in the meeting
			> scrum backlog is filled from the product Backlog
			> the tasks are aligned with the sprint goal
			> the tasks should be feasible within the sprint period
			> At the end scrum master should be clear on what is the increment and how will it be delivered
		
		> Sprint
			> actual time used to get the increment done
			> 2 weeks is the typical time
			> The more complex the work/ the less the sprint period should be
			> It should be flexible
			> During the sprint the scope may be changed with the product owner
			> Once the period is agreed upon is should not change because it will be the reference which the team will depend on
			> All events should happen during the sprint !!
				> I don't know why/how

		> Daily scrum/standup
			> Daily super short meeting
			> Usually in the morning
			> ~ 15 mins
			> The goal of this meeting is to 
				> bring every one to the same page
				> See if they are aligned with the sprint goal
				> Plan to unblock those who are blocked
				> get a plan for the next 24 hrs
			> A typical questions in the meeting to be asked
				> What did you doo yesterday ?
				> What will you do today ?
				> Are there any blockers
			> It helps people get more focus on the day goals

		> Sprint review
			> hold at the end of the Sprint
			> Preview a demo for the increment
			> Show to the stakeholders the job that is done on the backlog
			> Get a feedback from the customer/product owner
			> Should not exceed hrs

		> Sprint Retrospective
			> The team discuss what worked and what didn't in the prev sprint
			> Come up with suggestion of improvements
			> It should be more about how to get things right not on blaming each other

	> Scrum roles
		> 3 main roles
			> Product owner
			> Scrum master
			> Development team
				> devs
				> UI/UX designer
				> Testers
				> etc

		> Product owner
			> Champion of the product
			> Focused on
				> understanding the business, market & customers
				> prioritizing the work to be done by the development team
			> Effective product owners should 
				> Build and maintain the backlog
				> Closely be with the team to make sure that they understand the work
				> Give the team a clear guidance on what will be done next
				> Decides when to ship to product
			> Ensures the most value from the team
			> Should be individual, we don't want the team to get confused from two/more sources of guidance
