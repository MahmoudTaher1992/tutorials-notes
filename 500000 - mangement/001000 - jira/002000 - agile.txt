Agile
    > iterative approach to project management and software development
    > helps teams deliver value to their customers 
        > faster
        > fewer headaches
    > instead of delivering everything at once => its delivered bit by bit
    > Evaluations are done continuously for (so teams can respond to changes quickly)
        > Requirements
        > Plans
        > Results
    > Waterfall approach
        > Does all things at once and move it to the next phase
        > i.e.
            > planning is done for all the app
            > designs
            > programming
            > testing
            > customer changes
    > Agile works bit by bit
        > the team should be cross-functional
            > multiple roles
            > i.e.
                > designer
                > developer
                > product owner
                > scrum master
                > tester
                > may be CI/CD
        > The team should experience
            > Open collaboration and communication
            > Quick adaption
            > Trust
        > the team should 
            > take lead on how they will get the work done
            > self organizing around tasks and assignments
    > Agile is
        > a group of principles that guide you
        > not a set of events/ceremonies
        > not a development techniques
        > is a set of methodologies that makes commitment to tight feedback cycles and continuous improvement.
    > Agile Manifesto
        > a group of 17 devs put principles of agile
        > Principles
            > Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
            > Working software over comprehensive documentation
            > Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
            > Responding to change over following a plan
    > Why Agile ?
        > Quickly respond to customer feedback/changes (without waiting months!!), decreased costs
        > Flexibility in ways to achieve the goal (which is common in all agile teams)
            > Each team will have his own implementation
        > When the team feels that they have trust from the management they tend to perform better
