	> The heart of scrum framework
	> if done right helps teams ship better software with fewer headaches
	
	> How to plan and execute scrum Sprints ?
		> Sprint planning meeting (that answers 2 questions)
			> What will be done in the sprint ?
				> Collaborative work between product owner, scrum master and dev. team
				> The product owner sets that goal of the sprint and the backlog items that relates to it  
			> How will it be done ?
				> The team plans how to get it done during the sprint 
				> do a very detailed plan on all the work that will be done
				> Break down the work into stories, issues and bugs 

		> Daily standup
			> The team check how the progress is going
			> The team tries to resolve any blockers

		> Sprint Review
			> A meeting to show the stakeholders the increment before pushing it to production
		
		> Sprint retrospective
			> Discusses the improvements to be done in the future

	> Do's
		> Make sure that the team understands the sprint goal, it helps in getting it done.
		> Ensure that the backlog is groomed, organized and prioritized
		> Ensure you have a good understanding of velocity
		> In sprint planning 
			> do a very detailed plan on all the work that will be done
			> Break down the work into stories, issues and bugs 
		> Skip the work that needs a dependencies from other teams
		> Get every detail to the team management tool i.e. (JIRA)

	> Don't
		> Pull too many stories
		> Over estimate velocity (Seamus)
		> Forget about quality/technical debit
		> Forget to estimate time for bug-fixes/meetings/QA
		> Let the team has a fuzzy view on the sprint's goal
		> Take a large unknown/high-risk work
		> Ignore team's concern on velocity/low estimations
