Performance issues guidelines
    > to fix a performance issue you should do the following
        > identify the problem
            > the same way you did in the refactoring estimation
        > Benchmark
            > document the current performance of the code
            > this will give you what you have reached after the refactoring
            > i.e.
                > page load time
                > api response time
                > database query times
                > CPU/memory usage
                > ...
            > tools
                > profiling tools
        > Analyze
            > once you identify the problem, analyze what is the causes of it
            > it will involve examining the code base
        > Plan a solution
            > based on the solution, plan the solution
            > i.e.
                > rewriting parts of the code
                > optimizing the database queries
                > add some caching
                > reduce the size of the network data
                > upgrade the hardware
                > ...
        > Implementation
        > Measurement
            > measure the new measures and compare it to the benchmarks
        > Monitor
            > continue to monitor the performance over the time
